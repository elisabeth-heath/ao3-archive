                <div class="summary">Merlin’s been keeping a close eye on the Riddle boy. It’s the flirting with the Balance that sets Riddle apart, makes him Merlin’s business. Merlin’s never gone out of his way to involve himself. When Riddle drags a baby boy into his mess, though, it’s too far. It’s a little too close to that life-for-a-life business. A little too close to Queen Ygraine’s death. Arthur agrees.They’re not the only ones watching. Albus Dumbledore has inserted himself and is already deconstructing the situation, putting measures into place and making plans. The boy is taken care of. Merlin and Arthur make some plans of their own.-------------------Merlin and Arthur take note the night Harry Potter cheats death (the first time). When the boy turns 11, they decide it&#x27;s high time they went back to Hogwarts.</div>

                <div class="summary">Magic has been used in Ealdor and Merlin needs a distraction. Author: Emrys MK Title : Merlin&#x27;s Worries, Arthur&#x27;s Distractions Rating : M Characters/pairings : Merlin/Arthur, Leon/Percival, Gwen, Hunith Summary : Magic has been spotted in Ealdor and Merlin needs a distraction. Words : ~1000 Warnings: angst Prompt 184: Infinite A/N : Part nine of my reincarnation series Merlin and Arthur Live Again . I want to thank Lucy, who asked if I would write about Arthur&#x27;s past relationships. I haven&#x27;t delved into much yet, but I did give a hint into his past. More to come. If there are any other things readers wants me to write about, please let me know, and, if it fits in, I&#x27;ll do it. &quot;Last week, a local female citizen of Ealdor, population fifty-seven, was arrested. Details are sketchy, but it is believed that this female attempted to perform magic. While sorcery is not illegal, a new law went into effect last month requiring magics to register. This person was not registered, hence the detainment. We will continue to follow this story and keep you abreast of the latest developments. Jo-&quot; Merlin had heard enough; he turned off the telly and turned to see his mother&#x27;s reaction, and, just as expected, her face was pale and she was staring at him, a look of abject terror on her face. Merlin attempted a smile. &quot;It&#x27;s okay, Mum, you know I&#x27;m careful. No one here knows about me.&quot; &quot;If you&#x27;re found out, Merlin, they&#x27;ll take you away from us. They won&#x27;t listen to reason. The-&quot; Merlin had stood as she began speaking, walked to her, knelt, and taken her hands in his. &quot;Mum, don&#x27;t do this. There&#x27;s no reason why anyone should suspect anything. None of the neighbors know. The only ones who ever knew were Arthur and his mother. You&#x27;ll remember that they purposely did not tell Mr. Pendragon. There is nothing at all to worry about. I promise,&quot; Merlin said, hoping he sounded much more confident than he felt. The truth was he&#x27;d heard about the girl&#x27;s arrest a few days earlier and had been on heightened alert since, thinking that at any second someone would come arrest him and take him away. His mother nodded, but continued to look worried. &quot;It&#x27;s your father&#x27;s work, Merlin. I fear his dealings will come back to you. He travels so much and we don&#x27;t know what all he does, but we do know what he uses to do it. If he&#x27;s caught, then you know they&#x27;ll want to question and exploit you.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I know, but we can&#x27;t worry about that,&quot; Merlin said, knowing that he had no other choice but to sound and act as if this didn&#x27;t bother him. The last thing he wanted was for his mother to worry herself to death over this, and there was no doubt that she would do that very thing. Merlin knew that Hunith Emrys&#x27;s life was her son. &quot;It&#x27;ll be okay.&quot; He kissed her on the forehead. Thirty minutes later he received a text from Arthur: Hey, Merlin. I know we talked for two hours earlier, but I just saw the news and figured you needed a distraction. Are you busy? Merlin: No, I&#x27;m not busy. You know you can text or call anytime, and yes, distract me, please. Arthur: Remember the two guys we went out with Saturday night? Merlin: Yeah, really big blokes :-) Arthur: Yeah, well, today Leon called and told me Percy and he are together. Merlin: Seriously? Arthur: Yeah. Merlin: But I thought Leon was with your former girlfriend, Gwen. Arthur: Yeah, they were, but she caught Percy and him together this morning and told Leon she never wanted to see him again and that she should have stayed with me, that I knew how to treat a lady. Merlin: And does she know that you&#x27;d rather treat a bloke these days? Arthur: She didn&#x27;t, but she does now. Merlin: And how did that go down? Arthur: She called me just before I texted you and asked me if I wanted to meet her for drinks. She didn&#x27;t go into any detail about what happened but told me she and Leon were finished and that she regretted ending things with me last year. Merlin: And? Arthur: I told her I was with someone else. Merlin: And? Arthur: She asked me who. Merlin: You&#x27;re enjoying this, aren&#x27;t you? Arthur: Immensely. Merlin: So, did you tell her who? Arthur: I told her it was someone who didn&#x27;t live in Camelot. Her single word reply: Merlin. Merlin: And what did you say to that? Arthur: I told her yes, it was you and that I was flattered and I respected her and thought fondly of our time together, but that my heart now belonged to you and I hoped she and I could still be friends. Merlin: It works for Freya and me. Arthur: You can be friends with anyone, Merlin. I don&#x27;t make friends at all easily. My dad takes great pride in reminding me daily how much of a failure I am when it comes to being social. Merlin: I&#x27;ll never badmouth your father because hell hath no fury like me when someone speaks ill of either of my parents, but I so wish he could understand you like I do, Arthur. Arthur: Me too, Merlin, but back to Gwen. She said yes, that she wants to be friends and that she wants to meet you properly, not just in passing. Then she asked me when we were moving in together. I had to set her straight and tell her that just because we are two men who are together, it doesn&#x27;t mean we have to live together. I told her I plan to finish uni and you&#x27;re about to begin and that we are in no hurry to become domestic, that we have the rest of our lives to do that. But I did tell her that when it happens she&#x27;ll be the first to know. Merlin: I look forward to that day :-) and Gwen sounds a lot like Freya. Merlin was about to add to the text when his mother knocked on his door. &quot;Come in, Mum,&quot; he said, before finishing the text: Mum wants to talk so I&#x27;ve got to go. Talk to you tomorrow. Arthur: Have a good night, Merlin. Merlin: You, too, Arthur. Merlin&#x27;s mother walked into his room. &quot;Your father just called.&quot; &quot;And?&quot; asked a frantic Merlin, his breathing erratic. &quot;He wanted to tell me he accepted another job today; it has nothing to do with magic and the pay is substantially more. You can go to Avalon. Your opportunities are infinite, Merlin.&quot; Please drop by the archive and comment to let the author know if you enjoyed their work!</div>

When delivering the medicine, Arthur accidentally discovers Merlin’s magic while he is asleep, and wants to protect him when they return to Camelot. The only way is to supervise him when he is asleep, which makes for an awkward sleeping situation. The two become more and more close and the boundaries between magic and love become blurred as Arthur asks himself the question: how much is too much change?“Some things,” he continued, “when hidden, become explosive. Secrets create guilt where there is none. If people ask questions, let them. We don’t have to say anything more than the truth.”“What do you know?”“More than I should,” he rose up one step, now eye-to-eye, “and yet, less than I want to.”</div>

                <div class="summary">Quite simply, the lyrics of &#x27;The Confrontation&#x27; from Les Misérables rewritten for a scenario in which Arthur finds out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Notes I&#x27;ve really enjoyed seeing Les Mis at the cinema, and this is my favourite song. Then I told my friend Blackthorn14 (Find her on DA, Tumblr etc!) that someone should rewrite the words for Arthur finding out about Merlin&#x27;s magic. Then I had a go and so did she, and some of her lines were much better than mine, and some of mine she preferred over hers; so I did a bit of cutting and copying and some tweaking here and there, and what you see before you is a more or less equal collaboration. Unfortunately neither of us can sing, but we were pretty pleased with how it turned out, so it seemed a shame not to post it up somewhere... Someone clever Merlin cosplayers need to record this for us. Please, talented people of the internet, do it! For best effect, try singing this along to the track :) We used the film version, though :) [ARTHUR] Merlin, at last, Your secret becomes plain A sorcerer And Camelot’s betrayed [MERLIN] Before you say another word, Arthur Before you send me to the stake to burn Listen to me! There is something you should know. I was working for our destiny. Everything I did I did for you, For Camelot, I fought as best I knew We’re two sides of the same coin. Different sides- [ARTHUR] Merlin, stop it now! I&#x27;ve seen the things magic can do You deserve no trust from me A liar like you. [MERLIN(counterpoint)] Believe of me what you will This is something I had to do You don’t know what I’ve done All I did was save your life You know nothing I have done If not for me you would be dead My magic helped build Albion I am warning you Arthur You still need me by your side There is power in this world That you can’t face alone [ARTHUR(counterpoint)] You have tricked me all these years I considered you a friend No, It was all a lie How many men have I lost? How many fights? Come with me you sorcerer I’ll go on with my father’s deeds Our friendship means nothing now No mercy for scum like you You belong inside a jail All these years you’ve lived a lie You have treated me as a fool How could you keep this from me? I would have kept your secret well If you’d proved that you trust me I’d believe this destiny! Please drop by the archive and comment to let the author know if you enjoyed their work!</div>

                <div class="summary">Arthur remembered exactly three days after Merlin. But not much changed for him. His own feelings about Merlin didn’t require much examination after remembering. Arthur of the past had loved Gwen, sure, but Arthur of the past had also loved Merlin. Arthur of the past didn’t ever bother examining what those feelings meant, they hardly mattered, what with Morgana’s betrayal, and running a kingdom, and needing an heir. Merlin had been his manservant and his friend and he had loved him. It really wasn’t particularly complicated. Feelings in the present seemed to require much more examination. He wasn’t sure why his modern day self had to be so angsty, or perhaps his past self had just been rather shallow.</div>

                <div class="summary">Arthur and Merlin wake Gaius. They&#x27;re absolutely terrible liars. The homophobia is mostly implied, nothing outright. &quot;Merlin?&quot; Arthur hissed out, as he leaned into a crevice in the wall. &quot;Arthur! Finally.&quot; The dark haired boy popped out from his hiding place, bringing a relieved sigh from Arthur. &quot;I was held up. My father.&quot; Merlin nodded in understanding and the two slipped into the dark. Minutes later Merlin was pressed back against the stone wall, hips held down by Arthur&#x27;s hand. The blonde boy nipped gently at Merlin&#x27;s neck, murmuring into his ear. &quot;Missed you.&quot; Merlin sighed into the touch of Arthur&#x27;s lips, and the blonde brought his head up, bringing his lips to Merlin&#x27;s. The two pressed together, Merlin tugging his lover close. Several minutes later, the two broke apart, chests heaving and lips swollen. Merlin grinned up at Arthur, who returned the look. Arthur took Merlin by the hand and the two slipped quietly up to Merlin&#x27;s room. As soon as the door shut Arthur was pulling Merlin close again, seeking any touch. The blonde pushed Merlin back slightly, falling onto the bed. Merlin laughed, then clapped a hand over his mouth, his eyes twinkling. Arthur snorted, but the two quickly became involved in each other&#x27;s touch once again. Arthur lay on top of Merlin, cradling the dark haired boy&#x27;s face in his hand, and kissing the life out of him. Merlin wrapped his arms around Arthur, pulling him closer. Arthur slid one hand away from Merlin&#x27;s face, and slowly slid it under the fabric of Merlin&#x27;s shirt, his hand resting on Merlin&#x27;s stomach, a gentle warmth. Arthur&#x27;s lips traveled down Merlin&#x27;s neck, the smaller boy moaning quietly and the sensation. Arthur rested his other hand on Merlin&#x27;s chest, and then whispered out a rough, &quot;Off.&quot; Merlin sat up, tugging the shirt over his shoulders, before laying back down, a blush spreading down his neck to his chest. Arthur smirked at him, then re-connected their lips briefly, his mouth traveling slowly across Merlin&#x27;s torso, teasing his nipples gently, slowly, before traveling down further. He teased Merlin a bit, tracing patterns across Merlin&#x27;s stomach, knowing he was ticklish. &quot;Arthur!&quot; Merlin hissed, his stomach tensing in protest. Merlin shoved at Arthur&#x27;s head lightly, teasingly, but Arthur got off Merlin entirely. &quot;Oh, you want me off then?&quot; He smirked, and Merlin groaned. &quot;No, I don&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;You sure? You really seemed like you didn&#x27;t there.&quot; His tone was teasing, and Merlin replied with, &quot;I don&#x27;t want you tickling me, but I want you...there...&quot; &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;/There/. Arthur, you know what I mean!&quot; &quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Arthur said, murmuring into his ear, as he lowered his body back down onto Merlin&#x27;s. Merlin rolled his eyes, but muttered out, &quot;I want you on my cock.&quot; Arthur laughed, low in his throat. &quot;Perfect.&quot; The blonde slid back down to Merlin&#x27;s stomach, and after pressing a kiss to his belly button and getting a threatening glare from Merlin he went lower. Arthur grabbed at Merlin&#x27;s trousers, sliding them off his legs. His head went down, and Merlin&#x27;s back arched. ------- Sometime later Arthur lay on Merlins chest, both boys sweaty, their bare skin rosy from their activities. They lay in silence, snuggled into each other, their legs entwined, candlelight flickering on them. Merlin slid his hand onto Arthur&#x27;s cheek, tilting the blonde&#x27;s head so their eyes met. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Arthur mumbled sleepily. &quot;I love you.&quot; Arthur smiled, his eyes close to shutting. &quot;Love you too Mer.&quot; Suddenly, the door opened, showing the shocked face of Gaius. &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; The two jumped, Merlin trying to stutter out an excuse. &quot;Um, uh, I was jus- I mean, we were just-&quot; Arthur interuppted. &quot;We were just hot.&quot; Merlin glared at him when Gaius glanced away, to which Arthur raised his eyebrows, with an expression saying, &#x27;what else could I say.&#x27; &quot;You were hot then.&quot; Gaius said, clearly unbelieving, &quot;Why were you here in the first place then your Majesty? In Merlin&#x27;s bed of all places.&quot; &quot;Well, um,&quot; Now it was Arthur&#x27;s turn to sputter. &quot;He had a disagreement with his father, and needed some place to cool off. We got tired.&quot; Merlin offered. Gaius raised an eyebrow, and then sighed. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you could return to your room without confrontation from your father now my lord.&quot; &quot;Certainly.&quot; Arthur glanced at the door, knowing he was still undressed. &quot;I&#x27;ll leave in a moment.&quot; Arthur nodded at Gaius, who sighed and left the room, but not before giving Merlin a Look. As soon as the door shut, Arthur scrambled for his clothes, as did Merlin. &quot;Hey,&quot; Arthur said, catching sight of Merlin&#x27;s fearful face. &quot;We&#x27;ll be okay. I can see to that.&quot; Merlin nodded, and Arthur brushed his cheek softly with his hand, then leaned in for a quick, very quick kiss. The two went downstairs, and after bidding Gaius goodnight, Arthur was on his way. Merlin avoided the old man&#x27;s eyes, and tried to walk quietly to his room, but Gaius stopped him. &quot;So. Are you going to explain?&quot; &quot;I thought we already had.&quot; Gaius sighed, and sat down. &quot;Merlin. I&#x27;m not stupid. Besides the fact that both of your clothes were strewn about the floor and your bodies are both strewn with kissbruises, you are both terrible, terrible, liars.&quot; Merlin let out a gust of air, and sat down, his face in his hand. After a moment he raised his head, meeting Gaius&#x27;s eyes. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; &quot;Do you love him?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I asked you if you love him. Do you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Merlin whispered, eyes on the floor now. &quot;And he you?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How long?&quot; &quot;Less than a year. Eight months, in two weeks.&quot; &quot;Well. Invite him here tommorow, I just talk with him.&quot; Merlin looked up, wary. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m your guardian, I have to approve of him. He may be the kings son, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he gets to hurt my ward.&quot; Gaius looked down at Merlin kindly, whose face clearly showed his shock. &quot;You aren&#x27;t going to kick me out? Or report us?&quot; &quot;No, I&#x27;m not Merlin. I care for you, if Arthur is who makes you happy then so be it. Doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to go easy on him tommorow though.&quot; He said with a wink. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Merlin said, still somewhat dazed. &quot;Of course.&quot; Please drop by the archive and comment to let the author know if you enjoyed their work!</div>

It takes him more than a decade to finally tell him. Or: Five times Arthur wants to tell Merlin and one time he does. Notes This fic really fought me at every turn; first I couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea, and then I wasn&#x27;t in the mood, and then when I actually sat down and to write it would only come out by heavy force. But I’ve written and posted an autumn inspired fic every year since 2017 and I wasn’ t about to stop now . You couldn’ t best me, fic. (I’m actually pretty happy with how it turned out, all struggles considered!) For those of you who aren’ t familiar with the English school system, students are 1 1/12 years old in year 7 and 16/17 in sixth form! Also big thanks to the best Joji-san for sensitivity beta-ing Merlin for me!&lt;3 See the end of the work for more notes I. It’s early September and the days are not quite as warm as they’ve been. Arthur usually resents the coming of the cold, but this year he can’t help but grin when he pulls on his jacket over his school uniform. It’s not that he particularly likes the cold, but frigid and foggy mornings mean that the autumn term is finally starting and Arthur has looked forward to it since last semester ended. He loves the summer holidays and usually hates for them to end, but this year he hasn’ t been able to stop himself from wishing they would just be over already; he likes school well enough — he really likes learning about histor y and the sciences — but that’s not why he’s been almost bursting with excitement about going back. What’ s really been keeping him restless and eager the past few weeks has been the knowledge that with the start of the school term, comes meeting Merlin again. Arthur hasn’ t seen his best friend since the start of the summer, since Merlin has been away visiting family, and the summer has been dreadfully boring without him. Arthur is so excited to see him again he’s certain he’s been getting on his fathe r and sister ’s nerves with it — not that it stopped him from bouncing around the house this morning in his haste to get ready . And now, finally, he’s on his way to the first day of school for year seven. He’d be running if Morgana wasn’ t walking — like a snail because she’ s evil — with him. Arthur jumps up and down in his place on a pile of green leaves as he waits for her to catch up — she might as well crawl with how slowly she’ s walking. “Stop grinning like that, ” she says with a roll of her eyes. “One would think you have a crush on him, ” she adds and smirks. Arthur stops and scrunches his nose up. “I don’ t have a crush. Crushes are gross.” Morgana grins at him. “Sure, whatever . Just let me know if you need any help asking him to be your boyfriend, ” she says as she walks past him. “I don’t want him to be my boyfrien d, ” Arthur says with a frown as he falls into step with her. “I want him to be my friend.” “He can be both, you dummy, ” Mor gana tells him. “That’ s why it’ s called boy friend .” That makes Arthur pause in his steps, before he shakes his head and runs up to walk beside her again. “It’s a girl thing to have crushes, ” he says. He knows Elena talked about having crushes on some of the boys in year seven when they were still in year six, but he’s never heard any of his boy friends say anything about crushes. “And I’m not a girl.” Morgana snorts. “Then why did Father marry your mother?” she retorts. Arthur frowns in thought. He supposes that’s true, but he’s never had a crush before! Why would he have one on Merlin ? Aren’ t boys supposed to have crushes on girls, anyway? “But Merlin’ s not a girl either, ” he says, and Morgana pats him patronising ly on the shoulder because she thinks she knows so much more than he does just because she’ s two years older . “Doesn’ t mean you can’t like him, ” she says, and then she shoves him in old evil-sister - fashion, because apparently Arthur got so lost in his thoughts that he didn’ t notice they’d already reached the school. “See you later, brother!” she says, and then skips up the steps to meet her friends and leaves Arthur with a bunch of unanswered questions. Arthur frowns at her . Stupid Mor gana and her stupid friends. “Arthur!” He turns around at the sound of his name, grins widely when he spots Merlin — who is wrapped up in an oversized jacket and wears a neckerchief around his neck, even if it’ s barely below fifteen degrees outside, because he gets cold even when it’s not really all that chilly — and for gets all about crushes and Mor gana. He forgets it for a few hours, until lunch, when Merlin laughs loudly at Gwaine’ s stupid joke and Arthur ’s stomach flutters as if there are falling leaves or butterflies inside it. His eyes widen and he stops with his fork midway to his mouth. Maybe Morgana was right. Maybe he does want Merlin to be his boyfriend. For the rest of the day, Arthur can’t stop thinking about it, about how Merlin is kind of cute with his rosy cheeks and oversized jacket and clumsy boots, about how maybe Arthur wouldn’ t be so opposed to holding his hand, about how he would quite like to introduce Merlin as his ‘best friend and boyfriend’. Which means it’s become a thing that Arthur actually thinks might be true, which means that he has to tell Merlin about it, because they tell each other everything and Arthur isn’t about to start keeping secrets now. Only, he isn’t sure how to tell him. He’s not going to ask Morgana for help because she’s a witch who wants nothing but for Arthur to suffer, but who better to ask than his father, who is wise and smart and knows how everything works? So instead of going back to his room after dinner like he usually does, he follows his father to his office and stops outside it, rocking back and forth on his heels. His father’s office is dark mahogany and warm leather, and Arthur has always felt both intimidated and awed by it. “What is it, Arthur?” his father asks from his old leather chair, the evening paper in his hands. “Did everything go well at school today?” Arthur stops rocking on his feet and nods. “Y es, Father, it was fine, ” he says. “I was, uhm..” “Hesitation is not a desirable or respectable trait, Arthur . You should know better, ” his father says, not looking up from the paper . Arthur swallows, and then squares his shoulders. “You know Merlin, ” he says, and his father arches an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “W ell, I, uh- think I like him.” He means to go on, but his father looks up at him with a disapproving frow n that has Arthur snapping his mouth shut. “That’ s nonsense. Where did you get that idea?” he asks, and Arthur ’s shoulders hitch up just the slightest at the same time his stomach drops. “Uh- well, Mor gana said-“ His father scoffs. “Don’ t listen to your sister, she’s just trying to rile you up. You don’t like Merlin. Get that ridiculous notion out of your head. He’s a boy and so are you, ” he states, returning his focus to the paper . “Now, was there anything else?” “Erm, no, uh, thank you, ” Arthur says in a small voice. There’ s a lump in his throat and an uncomfortable feeling in his chest. His father dismisses him with a wave of his hand and Arthur quickly hurries to his room to bury himself under his duvet. Rain patters against his window . He suddenly feels very certain that he does have a crush on Merlin, and that he absolutely cannot tell him. II. The night air is chilly and wet, the late September rain filling the potholes in the road and leaving puddles on the pavement. The street lights flicker and the headlights of a passing car reflect in the pools of water, before the car drives through them and ruins it. There’ s a gale coming, the winds pulling at their clothes and nipping at their cheeks, the gloomy clouds rolling above their heads. Arthur blinks the wetness from his eyes and wipes the raindrop from his cheek and thinks that even the weather is miserable. He huddles into his worn hoodie in an attempt to stay warm, but even the heat from Merlin’ s leg pressed against his isn’t helping to stave off the early autumn chill. Arthur feels cold to the bone, and not just because of the wind that pushes cold air into the collar of his hoodie. They’ve started sixth form and it’s supposed to be exciting and fun and new, but all Arthur feels is lousy . “I don’t want you to leave, ” he mutters into his collar . It’s quiet and petulant and just the slightest bit angry, and Arthur doesn’ t care. He is angry, angry at Merlin for just up and leaving him like this with next to no warning. Only a few weeks ago things were great and Arthur was excited to start this new part of his life, and then Merlin went and told him he’s moving and everything turned horrible. Merlin sighs next to him, wrapped up in his thick jacket and the wool scarf Arthur knows his mother knitted him for Christmas two years ago; Arthur has a matching one, red to Merlin’ s blue. His cheeks are rosy red from the cold and his eyes are sad, their blue almost black in the dark of the night. “Me neither, ” he mumbles, burying his chin further into his scarf. “But with Mum’ s health we need to be closer to family and we can’t exactly ask them all to come to London, now can we?” he says with a laugh, but it sounds hollow in the dim street. Arthur doesn’t answer, because there really isn’t anything he can say, is there? It’s not like Merlin has a choice and Arthur can’t exactly demand that he leave his mother while she’s sick, no matter how much he wants him to stay . Merlin sighs again, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. “I’m going to miss it here, ” he says. A smile pulls at his lips as he watches the wet street and the dark park on the other side of it. “Remember when we were ten and we climbed the big tree and I broke my arm?” he asks, the corners of his eyes scrunching up just the slightest. As if Arthur could forget; he’d gotten a right heart attack, seeing Merlin cry and clutch his arm to his chest in pain. “The scolding from Mum was almost worse than the pain, ” Merlin contin ues with a laugh, and this one, at least, is real, if a little wet. He sniffles, grinning widely, and turns to Arthur . “But you were there the whole time — you wouldn’ t even leave the hospital. Told me stories about knights and sorcerers and drago ns to keep me distracted, and then you demanded that you got to write on my cast and you wrote your name so large no one else could fit theirs, like the self-entitled prat you are.” His smile softens into something a little sadder, and Arthur hates this so much. Hates saying goodbye. Doesn’ t even know if he knows how to. Merlin glances back at the clouds and the stars just starting to peek through them. “I’m going to miss you, ” he says, quietly, and Arthur thinks about telling him, then. About the feelings he’s been pushing away since he was eleven and his father told him he wasn’ t allowed to have them. About the flutters and the want and the maybe-I’m-in-love-with-you. Because this is Merlin and if he can’t tell Merlin then who could he ever hope to tell? If he can’t share this secret with Merlin — this secret that’s overwhelming and large and scary — then he doesn’ t think he can share it with anyone, and he’s not sure he can live with that. And he doesn’ t know when — if — he’ll see Merlin again, so if not now, when? But the words are too heavy in his chest and too big to travel through his throat and Arthur is too afraid and swallows them back down. “I say good riddan ce, ” he says instea d, knocking their shoulders together, because it’s easier than being vulnerable and he knows Merlin will get what he means anyway . Merlin grins at him, wet and sad and Arthur hates that he’s leaving. Hates that this is goodbye, even if neither of them actually says the word. “Prat.” III. Arthur and Merlin lose touch sometim e during the spring after Merlin leaves — because it’s difficult to keep in touch even when you really want to when you’re seventeen and everything around you is changing — and Arthur doesn’ t really expect for that to change. He certainly doesn’ t expect to find Merlin back in his life just a month into his first year at university, but here he is, sitting in the university library on a dark, wet Thursday evening in early October, when the leaves have just started to change colours into their bright yellows and vibra nt oranges and deep reds. And Merlin, dressed in a cozy, washe d out red sweater and taller and older than the Merlin that left, sits in front of him, typing away at his laptop. The librar y floor is silent besides the clacking of Merlin’ s keyboard and the occasional flip of a page from across the room where another group of students are sitting, their whispers quiet in the vast open space. It’s way too late to be studying, the world outside the windows dark save for the few streetlights strewn across campus. The rain patters agains t the glass and the occasional leaf falls past, illuminated by the lights from inside and the lamps outside. Arthur didn’t even know Merlin went to the same university as him until Gwen dragged Merlin along to their friend group’ s biweekly Sunday pub-quiz a few weeks ago and Merlin was promptly adopted into the group. Arthur didn’ t need the introduction Gwen gave, could have recognised Merlin anywhere, even when he was taller and older and just that much more pretty . And Merlin didn’ t seem to have any problem recognising him either, judging by the massive and heart-stopping grin he sent Arthur ’s way the moment their eyes met. Arthur thought he was over Merlin, he really did — not as a friend, because no number of years could ever remove how important Merlin has always been, but those nerve-wracking romantic feelings — and yet they’re there, right underneath his breastbone, humming and warm and as solid and real as they’d been the day he left Merlin on the steps to his building four years ago. And in the same way those feelings easily made their way back into Arthur ’s life, so did Merlin, and he’s made himself snug and comfortable as a constant presence that Arthur isn’t sure how he lived without for so long. Lance stretches beside Arthur, his bones cracking satisfyingly, and it reminds Arthur of just how long they’ve been sat here. “I think it’s time for me to head home, ” he says, closing his laptop and tucking it into his bag. “I’m pretty sure I’ll do better on the midterms if I actually get some sleep in between study sessions.” Arthur huffs out a laugh and leans back in his chair . He still has an assignment that needs to be submitted by midnight, but he really would love to go back to his own crappy dorm bed. “Sleep is for the weak, ” Merlin says, never taking his eyes of f his screen. Arthur and Lance share a look. Arthur shakes his head with a sigh. “I’ll follow you to the cafeteria, ” he says and stands up. “I’m going to need cof fee if I want to survive another two hours of this.” “Oh, get me one, will you?” Merlin asks. He’ s still not looking up from his laptop. Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “I’d tell you to get one yourself but I don’t think even a natural disaster could get you to move, ” he says. That, at least, gets Merlin to finally look up to grin at him. Lance chuckles, standing up and slinging his bag over his shoulder . “See you tomorrow, Merlin.” “See you tomorrow, Lance. Enjoy your sleep, ” Merlin says and turns to grin at him. “I will, ” Lance says. “Enjoy your studying.” “I won’ t.” “I’ll make sure he doesn’ t die, ” Arthur says, clasping Lance on the shoulder as he walks past him towards the stairs. He doesn’ t miss Merlin poking his tongue out at him, but Arthur is clearly the more mature person here because he stops himself from poking his tongue out right back at him. Lance laughs as he follows him, the sound loud in the quiet space. “And who’ s going to make sure you don’ t?” Arthur grins. “Merlin, of course.” Lance chuckles. “It’ll be a pleasant surprise if I see either of you alive and awake in the morning, then, ” he says and squeezes Arthur ’s shoulder . “Try to get some sleep at least.” “We will, ” Arthur says as they stop by the small cof fee hub. “T ell Gwen I said hi.” “Will do. Goodnight, Arthur, ” Lance says with a smile. “Night, ” Arthur says, waving him off as he leaves the library, and then steps up to the tired- looking student manning the cof fee. It’s only when he orders that he realises he doesn’ t know how Merlin likes his coffee. 16- year-old Merlin didn’ t drink coffee, and Arthur has only known 20-year -old Merlin for a few weeks. So he gets a vegan pumpkin spice latte for himself because he’s a basic bitch and it tastes good, and orders a large black coffee with just a bit of dairy-free-milk for Merlin and hopes it’ll do. That’ s how the Merlin he knew liked his tea. “One large dose of caffeine, ” he says as he places the takeaway mug next to Merlin’ s scattered notes. “Oh my god, thank you, ” Merlin says, moving the mug to his lips and taking a large gulp without so much as a wince. How he can drink it when it’s still scalding hot Arthur doesn’ t know, but he used to do that with hot chocolate and tea before too. “Oh, this is perfect. Thank you, Arthur, ” he says, grinning at Arthur with a brightness that rivals the bloody sun. Arthur hasn’ t seen Merlin in four years, and somehow it’s like no time has passed at all. He knows he doesn’ t really know this Merlin, this older version of him that has lived a life without Arthur, but he finds that he desperately wants to. Wants to know him in any way Merlin will let him, actually, and for a moment he wonders if this is the moment he should tell him. If it’s time to spill the secrets that are no longer held tightly against his chest but are still held close and only shared with a very select few. Maybe now, almost entirely alone on the third floor of the university library on a wet, dark evening in October, when they’re starting over and continuing on, is when he should let Merlin know how he feels. “Gosh I’m so happy to have you back in my life. I really missed you, ” Merlin says, grin soft around the edges, hair tousled just so and looking warm and cozy and like everything Arthur thinks he could ever want. Arthur ’s lips twitch into a smile hidden behind his mug, the steam curling warm around his nose. “No one managed to take my place, then?” he says, and Merlin laughs. “No, you prat. No one’s ego is large enough, ” he says. “But no, I’ve only ever had one best friend, ” he adds, smile wide and happy and warm, and Arthur doesn’ t want to risk ruining that, or the second chance they’ve been given. So he smiles back and tucks the feelings into the pocket he kept them in for so long before, and says, “Me too.” IV. “Merlin, do you really think this is a good idea? You don’t think it’s a little too.. on the nose?” Arthur asks as he twists and turns in front of the body-length mirror in Merlin’ s flat. It’s not that he doesn’t think he looks good — the costume is very high quality and Arthur is going to have to wear it for every single costume party for the rest of his life with how much it cost — but it feels a little too ridiculous. They’ve been teased about this since they became friends in primary; is it really necessary to add fuel to the flame? “That’ s why it’ s so good!” Merlin calls from the bathroom. Arthur sighs. The things he does for him. “Are you nearly finished or are we going to be three hours late again?” “Yeah yeah, done in a second! This bloody beard doesn’ t want to stick, ” Merlin says. “Need any help?” Arthur asks as he tightens the belt around his waist and pulls on his red cape. He grabs the small pink, purpl e, and blue dragon pin from Merlin’ s desk and fiddles with it. It’s his favourite pride pin, given to him by Merlin after he finally gathered up the courage to tell him that he likes people romantically and no one sexua lly, regardless of gender . It still scares him to wear it, despite the pride he feels. He wonders how long it’ll take before it stops making his stomach swoop anxiously, if it ever will stop. “No, all good!” Merlin says, and then he’s bouncing out from the bathroom and Arthur can’t help the loud laugh that escapes him. “You look absolutely ridiculous, ” he says. “Remind me to never let you grow a beard.” Merlin pouts at him, and it makes him look even more bizarre in his red robes and long white fake beard and scraggly wig. He’ s even added wrinkles. “Who said Merlin the Wizard had to be old?” Arthur asks, still fiddling with the pin in his hands. “Maybe he was a fit young sorcerer .” Merlin rolls his eyes and steps forward, hands reaching to grab the pin from Arthur ’s hands. He hums as he removes the pin lock. “King Arthur ’s young lover, perhaps?” he says, glancing up briefly at Arthur before he returns his attention to fastening the pin to Arthur ’s cape. Arthur swallows. “W ell, history always did have a way of being pretty gay .” Merlin snorts. “You can say that again.” He finishes fastening the pin, runs his hands over the fabric of the cape, and then steps back. He grins at Arthur . “Now we match, ” he says, tugging at his red robes and the bi-coloured butterfly and the non-binary he/him pins fastened on the left side of his chest. Arthur huf fs out a laugh, heart thudding in his chest. “You look great, ” Merlin adds, giving him a once-over . “The Great King of Camelot.” “Thanks, ” Arthur says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. “Y ou look old.” Merlin rolls his eyes at him again, and really it fits his costume perfectly . “Prat.” “That’ s Your Royal Prat to you, Sorce rer, ” Arthur says as he makes sure he has all his things and picks up Merli n’s phone before grabbing hold of Merlin’ s arm. “Now come on, the court awaits us.” Gwaine has really gone all out. His house is decked out with skeletons and ghosts and spider - web, a row of pumpkins that Arthur recognises from their annual pumpkin-carving competition litters his front porch, and the music blasting from the living room is nothing if not the Ghostbusters soundtrack. Gwaine himself is dressed in a leather costume that shows more skin than perhaps is socially acceptable but is entirely expected from him and a winged eyeliner that even Arthur is jealous of even if he very rarely wears makeup. No way the Playboy bunnies are getting all the fun, as Gwai ne said a few years ago when he wore a literal Playboy bunny outfit for Halloween. He’ s only outdone himself since. “Friends! You made it, ” he calls when they walk through the door. “I’m loving the couple’ s costume, ” he says with a wide grin. Arthur rolls his eyes at him and lets himself be pulled into a mostly naked hug. “Thanks. It was all Merlin’ s idea, ” he says when Gwaine pulls Merlin into a similar hug. Gwaine grins at Merlin, slapping him on the shoulder . “Of course it was.” Merlin grins back at him proudly . His fake beard is already starting to peel, so Arthur pushes it back in place. “You want anything to drink?” Gwaine asks, motioning towards the kitchen that is only a little less crowded than the living room and the hall. Arthur shrugs. “Why not.” “I’m alright, thanks. I’m going to find Gwen! I promised her I’d show her my outfit as soon as I came, ” Merlin says, waving them off and disappearing into the throng of people and further into the house. “Alright then, what can I offer you, Princess?” Gwaine asks as he leads Arthur into the kitchen. There are orange streamers hanging from the ceiling and the kitchen table is littered with an array of drinks and bottles. Arthur rolls his eyes again. “Honestly, anything’ s fine so long as it’s not deadly . I do have to attend lunch with my father and sister tomorrow, and as much as I think Morgana would love to see me hungover I don’t think Father would be too impressed, ” he says, scowling when Gwaine grins at him. “Your daddy’s always been a stick in the mud, ” he says, and Arthur scrunc hes his nose up at the choice of word, but can’t disagr ee with the rest. “I’m going to make you a potion of courage so you can finally get around to telling Merlin how you feel. You’ll only feel it a little in the morning, I promise, ” he says with a smile that tells Arthur he’s definitely going to feel it more than a little. Arthur purses his lips and gives him an unimpressed glare, but doesn’ t stop him when Gwaine grabs a few of the bottles strewn across the table and starts pouring liquids of different colours into a glass. “Oh, come on, mate. You’ve been pining for him since primary school. Don’ t you think it’s about time?” Honestly Arthur doesn’ t know why he ever told Gwaine about his feelings for Merlin, but then he probably wasn’ t very sober when he did and it was definitely Gwaine and his scarily- tasty, very-alcoholic drinks’ fault. He raises an eyebrow when Gwaine drops a small, round item into his drink and holds it out to him. “And I’m perfectly fine pining until I die, ” he says, taking the glass and watching the fake eye bob up and down in the colourful drink. He gives Gwaine a skeptical look before taking a sip. “Oh my god, ” he says, making a face. It’ s way too strong and tastes way too good. “What the hell did you put in this?” Gwaine just grins at him and slaps him on the shoulder . “Just think about it, ” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen. Arthur doesn’ t tell him that he has thought about it, multiple times. He takes another sip from the drink and grimaces again. God he’s not having any more to drink after this one. Arthur has thought about it, more times than he can count, really, has been close to telling Merlin a handful of times too. And yet, Gwaine’ s words make him think about it again, because honestly he isn’t sure he really is fine pining until the day he dies. He loves being friends with Merlin more than anything and if that’ s what they’re always going to be then that is more than fine with him, but he’s not sure he could go his entire life not knowing if that’s what Merlin wants or if their relationship could be something else. It’s probably the ridiculous amount of alcohol in the drink Gwaine made, but he’s feeling a little daring tonight. He won’ t ever know what Merlin feels if he never asks, right? So he spends almost half an hour walking through Gwaine’ s house trying to find Merlin somewhere in the crowd of witches and superheroes and pirates and ghosts, with little success. But he’ s made up his mind now, and like hell he’ s going to chicken out. It’s only when he goes outside into the cold night air that he spots him in the corner of the garden, face softly illuminated by the string of yellow lights hanging in the red and orange trees. He’s sitting, rather close, too, and laughing with a girl — Freya, Arthur thinks, from one of Merlin’ s nerdy societies. They’re turned towards each other, knees touching and smiles on their faces, caught in conve rsation. They look like they’ve forgotten the rest of the world exists, as if there’ s only the two of them, and Arthur ’s stomach drops. He guesses he wasn’ t meant to tell Merlin today either . He’s just about to turn around and go back inside when Merlin spots him. Merlin turns and grins at him, and Arthur, in turn, just gives him an awkward wave. Merlin turns back to Freya, saying something that has her smiling widely and nodding, and then he ducks in to leave a lingering kiss on her cheek before standing up and making his way towards Arthur . He doesn’ t take his eyes off her until he’s reached him, and Arthur supposes there’ s no need to ask. It’ s plenty obvious what Merlin feels. So, instead, he forces a grin and wiggles his eyebrows when Merlin finally looks at him. Merlin just laughs, cheeks dusted red, and punches him in the arm. V. The tube is crowded, with people packed shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and groups of friends squeezed too many into a row of seats. Arthur is tucked — more like wedged, really — between Merlin and Percival, the rest of their friends crammed in around them. There’ s really no use in trying to follow any of the conversations happening around him with the loud noise of the train and the laughter and chatter filling the car from all directions, and it’s much too tight to get a hold of his phone, so Arthur settles with staring off into the space in front of him. Which happens to hold a glum looking Merlin. It’s not very cold on the tube — the body temperature of all eight hundre d or so people are doing wonders against the early November cold — but Merlin is wrapped up in his usual blue scarf, chin tucked into it, and huddled into a thick rust red jacket. The dark grey wool beanie he’s wear ing has a small cat with a red neckerchief on the brim, his dark hair curling around it. He’s clearly trying to follow whatev er conversation Morgana, Leon, Lance, and Gwen are having on the other side of Percival, but Arthur can barely hear them so he figures Merlin isn’t much better off. He knows why he’s trying though, knows why there’s a small frown pulling at his brow and why there’ s a tired set to his shoulders and bags under his eyes. Arthur wishes he could help, wishes he could cheer him up, get him out of his own head and forget about Freya for a moment, but he’s shit at these things. What do you tell someone who’ s just been broken up with by their year-long girlfriend? Merlin really liked Freya, probably even loved her; what do you say to someone who’ s gotten their heart broken? Arthur isn’t sure he’d want anyone to say anything reassuring to him at all, honestly . It’s all empty words, anyway . So he doesn’ t say anything reassuring. Instead, he says, “Your face is going to get stuck if you keep frowning like that, ” because he’ s an idiot. Merlin rolls his eyes at him, but the frown loosens up just the slightest, so Arthur takes it as a win. “You’re one to speak, with how you brood half the time. You’re going to get wrinkles, ” Merlin retorts. Arthur gapes at him, af fronted. “I don’ t brood!” Merlin snorts. He squeezes his hand up between them and runs his thumb over Arthur ’s forehead. “Then what’ s this, Mr. Sunshine?” he says, and Arthur immediately tries to relax the scowl he’d barely noticed. “I’m a delight, thank you very much.” Merlin huffs out a laugh, and it’s a little happier, at least. Instead of trying to pull his arm down to his side again, he simply lets it rest against Arthur ’s chest, hand steady on his shoulder . Arthur wonders if Merlin can feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. “You’re about as delightful as the flu, ” Merlin tells him. Arthur can’t help himself, and smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “What, getting you all hot and bothered?” he asks, and Merlin lets out a loud, startled laugh. Warmth fills Arthur ’s chest at the look Merlin gives him, his eyes twinkling with mirth. He hasn’ t seen Merlin smile so widely in weeks. He grins crookedly back at him. “You wish, ” Merlin says, and becaus e their proximity means he can’t punch Arthur in the arm like he usually would, he resorts to pinching his neck lightly . Arthur complains out loud, and wonders silently if he should admit that yes, he kind of does. “This station is W ood Gr een, ” the announcement sounds over the intercom, and as soon as the tube stops almost the entire car fills out into the station. And from there it’s a rush of bodies and excitement and street food and drinks, watching the large bonfire get lit and its fire grow, yelling more than speaking the rhyme, and cheering over the morbid tradition of watching a man made of straw be set on fire. It’s fun and pleasant and the drinks are warm where the night is cold, and they’re all bundled together as close to the fire as they can get. Arthur stands next to Merlin, a cup of hot apple cider in his hands, watchin g from the corner of his eye as Merlin stares absentmindedly into the fire. The light of the bonfire casts shadows and a yellow glow across his face that makes him look ethereal. The quiet content in his eyes has Arthu r’s heart aching in his chest, because Merlin deserves this always, to feel content and happy and cherished. Merlin deserves to know that someone loves him, now more than ever, when he feels broken and unloveable. It’s their final year, and while Arthur doesn’ t think he could let go of Merl in again so easily, they’re graduating soon and life takes turns you don’t expect it to. He might not get another chance, might not gather up the courage again before it’ s too late. “Merlin, ” he starts, and Merlin turns to him with a hum, eyes softly crinkled at the corners. His cheeks are a little rosy from the nipping wind, but he looks warm and comfortable and Arthur is so ridiculously in love. Arthur opens his mouth to continue — to tell him, finally — but that’s when the first firework goes off and the world is lit with a wonderful array of colours. Merlin turns his head with a surprised laugh to watch the display in the night sky, but Arthur pays more attention to the way the colours illuminate Merlin’ s face and how they reflect in his wide, awestruck eyes. Merlin’ s face is lit up in delight by the time the colours fade. He turns to Arthur with a blinding smile, and Arthur swallows. Because he can’t risk taking this away from him, not now, not for such selfish reasons as his own. “What were you going to say?” Merlin asks, and Arthur shakes his head. There’ll be another time, a time when Merlin isn’t heart broken and his eyes don’t reflect the night sky, when Arthur can form the words instead of just wanting to stare at him in awe. “Nothing, ” he says. “Just… glad you’re here.” Merlin beams at him and bumps their shoulders. He doesn’ t pull away afterwards. “Me too.” + I. It’s a cold, wet Saturday in late Novem ber. The air is cold and the trees are bare, and the day has been lovely, the air crisp and the sky blue — up until about an hour ago. Then lunchtime came around and so did the dark clouds hanging heavy over Arthur ’s head, and of course it would start pouring down the mome nt he stepped out from the safety of the under ground station. As he rushes through the streets in the rain he’s eternally grateful that he had the foresight to bring a raincoat and that Merlin decided on meeting for a coffee rather than the walk he first suggested. A bell jingles as he pushes the door to The Round Table open and steps inside, coat dripping water onto the floor despite the short trip from the station to the café. He pulls the hood down and unzips the coat as he glances around the small and cozy space. It’s of little surprise that Merlin is nowhere to be seen; he does have a penchant for being late. Arthur decides to order while he waits, and scans over the menus above the bar. They’re all changed from their autumn and Halloween specials to limited winter and Christmas drinks, and the shelves are lined with yule logs, Christmas puddings, and fruity mince pies amongst their usual pastries and cakes. The only thing that’s missing, really, is the Christmas decoration and All I Want For Christmas Is You playing from the speakers, but Arthur figures it’s probably only a matter of days. He doesn ’t dislike Christmas per se, but he doesn’ t usually try to get himself into the Christmas spirit until December 1st, so he’s happy to see they still offer their autumn assortment. He orders a vegan caramel and hazelnut latte and a black coffee with a splash of dairy-free milk and a pinch of cinnam on. Just as he’s about to pay he throws in one of the gingerbread muffins too because he can’t help himself. It’s only a week until December, anyway . He’s just sat down with the drinks and the pastry when the bell above the door jingles again, a mop of wet, dark hair and dark blue eyes looking around until they spot him. Merlin grins widely and makes his way through the café. The corner of Arthur ’s mouth tugs up just the slightest. “Sorry I’m late!” Merlin says when he reaches him, and he does at least have the decency to look like he means it. “I forgot my umbrella at home and was hoping I could wait out the rain at the station, ” he says as he shrugs off his wet coat and hangs it over the chair in front of Arthur . His hair is dripping water onto his dark green sweater and his cheeks are flushed a bright red from the cold. Arthur rolls his eyes good heartedly . “Only you, Merlin.” “That’ s not true!” Merlin exclaims, ruffling his hair and successfully splattering water droplets everywhere. “The forecast didn’ t say anything about a downpour!” “It did say it was going to rain, ” Arthur points out. Merlin rolls his eyes as he steps aroun d the table. “It didn’ t say it was going to rain this much . Clotpole, ” he says, and then he bends down and pulls Arthur into a tight, warm — if a little wet — hug. “I missed you.” Arthur wraps his arms around Merlin’ s back and hugs him back just as tightly . It’s only been a few months, and it’s not like they haven’ t talked, but between internships and work and Merlin being away as part of his graduate position, they’ve barely had any time to meet since graduation. And Arthur has missed him something fiercely . “We talked yesterday, ” he says, just to be an arse, and Merlin huffs out a laugh and hugs him just a little tighter . Arthur grins. “I missed you too.” Merlin squeezes him one more time and then he pulls back, plopping into his chair and pulling his waiting cup of coffee towards him. He takes a sip and hums satisfied, his lips pulling into a grin. The corners of it are soft and warm. “So, what ’s happened in your life? I want to know everything, ” he says, leaning his elbows against the table. Arthur huffs out a laugh and takes a sip from his own warm drink. “You already know everything, ” he says. “Nothing new has happened in the last eighteen hours, surprisingly enough.” Merlin just continues to grin at him. “How was the Halloween party?” “Good, ” Arthur says. “Gwaine and Percy fell into the pool and Leon had to pull them out. They were both grounded and forced to spend the rest of the night sobering up in Gwaine’ s bathroom, ” he tells him with a chuck le. “And Gwen looked so gorgeous in her costume we all thought Lance was going to get down and propose any second.” He grins. “Although I think he’ s probably got something a little more special planned.” Merlin chuckles. “Maybe not the most romantic situation when people are dressed up in outfits ranging from nothing to absolute absurdity and everyone is well beyond drunk. Good choice, Lance.” “I’m pretty sure Gwen would say yes if he proposed in a dumpster, to be fair .” Merlin laughs, warm and happy . “Yeah, she would.” “My costume wasn’ t nearly as good without my sorcerer, though, ” Arthur says, and Merlin smiles widely . “I’m sure the mighty King Arthur is just as striking without him, ” he says. Arthur shrugs. “Maybe, ” he says, hiding his smile behind his cup. “But he definitely felt like something was missing.” Merlin’ s bright eyes crinkle at the corners. “I guess his sorcerer will have to make sure to show up next time, then, ” he says. “I’m holding you to that, ” Arthur says, giving him a pointed look. “So, how was Manchester? Seemed like you had a lot of fun.” Merlin’ s entire face lights up. “I did! It was so interesting to finally see everything I’ve learnt actually be used in practice, you know?” he says, and then he goes on a ramble about everything he saw in the three months he was away, everyone he met, all the things he got to do. Arthur has already heard more than half of this, but he has only heard it over the phone and through video calls with poor connection, and he’ll never mind hearing Merlin speak, no matter how many times he has to hear the same thing. A little distance and four months apart and the feelings in Arthur ’s chest haven’ t diminished in the slightest. At this point he figures they probably never will. “-and Sefa has promised to come here just before Christmas; we were thinking of heading up to Edinbur gh for the Christmas market. I’m just really excited to see her again, even if we saw each other a few weeks ago, ” Merlin says with a laugh. He speaks about her a lot, Sefa, and it’ s clear he likes her . Arthur just isn’ t sure in which way . So he raises his eyebrow suggestively, and Merlin’ s quick to wave him of f. “No, it’s nothing like that, ” he says with a chuckle. “We’re friends, and I’m pretty sure she and Daegal have something going on, ” he adds and grins. Arthur nods in understanding, but frowns when Merlin gives him a funny look. “How about you?” Merlin asks, averting his eyes and grabbing one of the forks on the table. He pokes at the gingerbread muffin. “Mithian seems nice, ” he says, and there’ s a strange tilt to his voice. And sure, Mithian is nice. Quite lovely, actually, and Arthur could see something happening between them, if he wasn’ t so damn gone on the person sitting in front of him. And so, this time, Arthur doesn’ t hesitate, doesn’ t stop himself or let himself back down. This time, he lets the words he’s wanted to say for so long roll off his tongue with an ease that really isn’ t all that surprising. “She is, ” Merlin’ s lips tug up into something that is probably supposed to be a smile but looks more like a grimace, “but I’m far too busy pining over my best friend for the nth year in a row to really consider it.” It feels not so scary and very relievin g, to finally share the secret he never wanted to keep to begin with. Merlin snaps his head up to stare at him with wide eyes and Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “Oh come on, you can’ t be that oblivious.” Merlin huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “No. I just wasn’ t expecting you to actually admit it, ” he says, and Arthur frowns at him. “I’ve been waiting for you to say something since we were fifteen.” Arthur balks. “Why did you wait for me to say something? If you knew, why didn’ t you say so?” Merlin shrugs, shoving a piece of muffin into his mouth. “I didn’ t want to force you to share something you weren’ t ready for, or feel like you were obligated to do anything about it. I know your dad isn’ t…” he grimaces, “the most approving.” Arthur snorts. “No shit. But seriously, since year ten?” he asks, and Merlin nods. Arthur huffs out a laugh, and leans back in his chair . “Guess all my anxiety about telling you was pretty unnecessary .” Merlin gives him a soft smile. “Y ou never needed to be anxious.” “I know, ” Arthur says with a sigh. “I’ve wanted you to know since I figured it out, but it always came up at bad times or something came in the way and ruined the moment, ” he says. Merlin laughs. “But at a café on a random, miserable Saturday afternoon fit the bill?” he asks, mirth in his eyes. Arthur pushes down his own grin and shrugs. “Figured it was as good a day as any .” “Say it again, ” Merlin says, leaning forward in his chair, his lips stretching wide as he smiles. Arthur rolls his eyes at him, but he feels his smile tug at his own cheeks. “I love you.” “I know that, ” Merlin says with laughter in his voice. “Say the other thing, ” he tells him. Arthur huf fs out a breath of a laugh and moves forwards so he’ s also leaning over the table. “I’m in love with you, ” he says, holding Merlin’ s gaze. He doesn’ t bother fighting the smile anymore. “Have been since I was eleven.” Merlin grins, wide and bright and warm, and then he ducks forward and his lips catch Arthur ’s in a kiss that tastes like cinnamon and coffee and caramel. It is new and exciting just the same as it feels entirely natural, like something Arthur has done a hundred times before, something he’ll do hundreds and hundreds of times again. “Good, ” Merlin says when he pulls away . “Because I’m in love with you too and I’d really like to add ‘boyfriend’ to the list of things I refer to you as in my head.” Arthur runs a thumb over Merlin’ s cheekbone and raises an eyebrow . He probably shouldn’ t ask, but he can’ t help himself. “Oh? And what other names do you have on that list?” “Clotpoll. Prat. Best friend. Ass. Arthur . Cabbagehead. Love of my life. Dollophead.” He laughs and kisses Merlin again. “Wouldn’ t be a complete list without boyfriend on there, would it?” Merlin grins at him again, bright and warm enough to rival the sun. “No, no it wouldn’ t.” End Notes Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!

It takes him more than a decade to finally tell him. Or: Five times Arthur wants to tell Merlin and one time he does. Notes This fic really fought me at every turn; first I couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea, and then I wasn&#x27;t in the mood, and then when I actually sat down and to write it would only come out by heavy force. But I’ve written and posted an autumn inspired fic every year since 2017 and I wasn’ t about to stop now . You couldn’ t best me, fic. (I’m actually pretty happy with how it turned out, all struggles considered!) For those of you who aren’ t familiar with the English school system, students are 1 1/12 years old in year 7 and 16/17 in sixth form! Also big thanks to the best Joji-san for sensitivity beta-ing Merlin for me!&lt;3 See the end of the work for more notes I. It’s early September and the days are not quite as warm as they’ve been. Arthur usually resents the coming of the cold, but this year he can’t help but grin when he pulls on his jacket over his school uniform. It’s not that he particularly likes the cold, but frigid and foggy mornings mean that the autumn term is finally starting and Arthur has looked forward to it since last semester ended. He loves the summer holidays and usually hates for them to end, but this year he hasn’ t been able to stop himself from wishing they would just be over already; he likes school well enough — he really likes learning about histor y and the sciences — but that’s not why he’s been almost bursting with excitement about going back. What’ s really been keeping him restless and eager the past few weeks has been the knowledge that with the start of the school term, comes meeting Merlin again. Arthur hasn’ t seen his best friend since the start of the summer , since Merlin has been away visiting family , and the summer has been dreadfully boring without him. Arthur is so excited to see him again he’s certain he’s been getting on his fathe r and sister ’s nerves with it — not that it stopped him from bouncing around the house this morning in his haste to get ready . And now, finally , he’s on his way to the first day of school for year seven. He’d be running if Morgana wasn’ t walking — like a snail because she’ s evil — with him. Arthur jumps up and down in his place on a pile of green leaves as he waits for her to catch up — she might as well crawl with how slowly she’ s walking. “Stop grinning like that,” she says with a roll of her eyes. “One would think you have a crush on him,” she adds and smirks. Arthur stops and scrunches his nose up. “I don’ t have a crush. Crushes are gross.” Morgana grins at him. “Sure, whatever . Just let me know if you need any help asking him to be your boyfriend,” she says as she walks past him. “I don’t want him to be my boyfrien d,” Arthur says with a frown as he falls into step with her. “I want him to be my friend.” “He can be both, you dummy ,” Mor gana tells him. “That’ s why it’ s called boy friend .” That makes Arthur pause in his steps, before he shakes his head and runs up to walk beside her again. “It’s a girl thing to have crushes,” he says. He knows Elena talked about having crushes on some of the boys in year seven when they were still in year six, but he’s never heard any of his boy friends say anything about crushes. “And I’m not a girl.” Morgana snorts. “Then why did Father marry your mother?” she retorts. Arthur frowns in thought. He supposes that’s true, but he’s never had a crush before! Why would he have one on Merlin ? Aren’ t boys supposed to have crushes on girls, anyway? “But Merlin’ s not a girl either ,” he says, and Morgana pats him patronising ly on the shoulder because she thinks she knows so much more than he does just because she’ s two years older . “Doesn’ t mean you can’t like him,” she says, and then she shoves him in old evil-sister - fashion, because apparently Arthur got so lost in his thoughts that he didn’ t notice they’d already reached the school. “See you later, brother!” she says, and then skips up the steps to meet her friends and leaves Arthur with a bunch of unanswered questions. Arthur frowns at her . Stupid Mor gana and her stupid friends. “Arthur!” He turns around at the sound of his name, grins widely when he spots Merlin — who is wrapped up in an oversized jacket and wears a neckerchief around his neck, even if it’ s barely below fifteen degrees outside, because he gets cold even when it’s not really all that chilly — and for gets all about crushes and Mor gana. He forgets it for a few hours, until lunch, when Merlin laughs loudly at Gwaine’ s stupid joke and Arthur ’s stomach flutters as if there are falling leaves or butterflies inside it. His eyes widen and he stops with his fork midway to his mouth. Maybe Morgana was right. Maybe he does want Merlin to be his boyfriend. For the rest of the day, Arthur can’t stop thinking about it, about how Merlin is kind of cute with his rosy cheeks and oversized jacket and clumsy boots, about how maybe Arthur wouldn’ t be so opposed to holding his hand, about how he would quite like to introduce Merlin as his ‘best friend and boyfriend’. Which means it’s become a thing that Arthur actually thinks might be true, which means that he has to tell Merlin about it, because they tell each other everything and Arthur isn’t about to start keeping secrets now. Only , he isn’t sure how to tell him. He’s not going to ask Morgana for help because she’s a witch who wants nothing but for Arthur to suffer, but who better to ask than his father , who is wise and smart and knows how everything works? So instead of going back to his room after dinner like he usually does, he follows his father to his office and stops outside it, rocking back and forth on his heels. His father’s office is dark mahogany and warm leather , and Arthur has always felt both intimidated and awed by it. “What is it, Arthur?” his father asks from his old leather chair , the evening paper in his hands. “Did everything go well at school today?” Arthur stops rocking on his feet and nods. “Y es, Father , it was fine,” he says. “I was, uhm..” “Hesitation is not a desirable or respectable trait, Arthur . You should know better ,” his father says, not looking up from the paper . Arthur swallows, and then squares his shoulders. “You know Merlin,” he says, and his father arches an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “W ell, I, uh- think I like him.” He means to go on, but his father looks up at him with a disapproving frow n that has Arthur snapping his mouth shut. “That’ s nonsense. Where did you get that idea?” he asks, and Arthur ’s shoulders hitch up just the slightest at the same time his stomach drops. “Uh- well, Mor gana said-“ His father scoffs. “Don’ t listen to your sister , she’s just trying to rile you up. You don’t like Merlin. Get that ridiculous notion out of your head. He’s a boy and so are you,” he states, returning his focus to the paper . “Now , was there anything else?” “Erm, no, uh, thank you,” Arthur says in a small voice. There’ s a lump in his throat and an uncomfortable feeling in his chest. His father dismisses him with a wave of his hand and Arthur quickly hurries to his room to bury himself under his duvet. Rain patters against his window . He suddenly feels very certain that he does have a crush on Merlin, and that he absolutely cannot tell him. II. The night air is chilly and wet, the late September rain filling the potholes in the road and leaving puddles on the pavement. The street lights flicker and the headlights of a passing car reflect in the pools of water , before the car drives through them and ruins it. There’ s a gale coming, the winds pulling at their clothes and nipping at their cheeks, the gloomy clouds rolling above their heads. Arthur blinks the wetness from his eyes and wipes the raindrop from his cheek and thinks that even the weather is miserable. He huddles into his worn hoodie in an attempt to stay warm, but even the heat from Merlin’ s leg pressed against his isn’t helping to stave off the early autumn chill. Arthur feels cold to the bone, and not just because of the wind that pushes cold air into the collar of his hoodie. They’ve started sixth form and it’s supposed to be exciting and fun and new, but all Arthur feels is lousy . “I don’t want you to leave,” he mutters into his collar . It’s quiet and petulant and just the slightest bit angry , and Arthur doesn’ t care. He is angry , angry at Merlin for just up and leaving him like this with next to no warning. Only a few weeks ago things were great and Arthur was excited to start this new part of his life, and then Merlin went and told him he’s moving and everything turned horrible. Merlin sighs next to him, wrapped up in his thick jacket and the wool scarf Arthur knows his mother knitted him for Christmas two years ago; Arthur has a matching one, red to Merlin’ s blue. His cheeks are rosy red from the cold and his eyes are sad, their blue almost black in the dark of the night. “Me neither ,” he mumbles, burying his chin further into his scarf. “But with Mum’ s health we need to be closer to family and we can’t exactly ask them all to come to London, now can we?” he says with a laugh, but it sounds hollow in the dim street. Arthur doesn’t answer, because there really isn’t anything he can say, is there? It’s not like Merlin has a choice and Arthur can’t exactly demand that he leave his mother while she’s sick, no matter how much he wants him to stay . Merlin sighs again, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. “I’m going to miss it here,” he says. A smile pulls at his lips as he watches the wet street and the dark park on the other side of it. “Remember when we were ten and we climbed the big tree and I broke my arm?” he asks, the corners of his eyes scrunching up just the slightest. As if Arthur could forget; he’d gotten a right heart attack, seeing Merlin cry and clutch his arm to his chest in pain. “The scolding from Mum was almost worse than the pain,” Merlin contin ues with a laugh, and this one, at least, is real, if a little wet. He sniffles, grinning widely , and turns to Arthur . “But you were there the whole time — you wouldn’ t even leave the hospital. Told me stories about knights and sorcerers and drago ns to keep me distracted, and then you demanded that you got to write on my cast and you wrote your name so large no one else could fit theirs, like the self-entitled prat you are.” His smile softens into something a little sadder , and Arthur hates this so much. Hates saying goodbye. Doesn’ t even know if he knows how to. Merlin glances back at the clouds and the stars just starting to peek through them. “I’m going to miss you,” he says, quietly , and Arthur thinks about telling him, then. About the feelings he’s been pushing away since he was eleven and his father told him he wasn’ t allowed to have them. About the flutters and the want and the maybe-I’m-in-love-with-you. Because this is Merlin and if he can’t tell Merlin then who could he ever hope to tell? If he can’t share this secret with Merlin — this secret that’s overwhelming and large and scary — then he doesn’ t think he can share it with anyone, and he’s not sure he can live with that. And he doesn’ t know when — if — he’ll see Merlin again, so if not now , when? But the words are too heavy in his chest and too big to travel through his throat and Arthur is too afraid and swallows them back down. “I say good riddan ce,” he says instea d, knocking their shoulders together , because it’s easier than being vulnerable and he knows Merlin will get what he means anyway . Merlin grins at him, wet and sad and Arthur hates that he’s leaving. Hates that this is goodbye, even if neither of them actually says the word. “Prat.” III. Arthur and Merlin lose touch sometim e during the spring after Merlin leaves — because it’s difficult to keep in touch even when you really want to when you’re seventeen and everything around you is changing — and Arthur doesn’ t really expect for that to change. He certainly doesn’ t expect to find Merlin back in his life just a month into his first year at university , but here he is, sitting in the university library on a dark, wet Thursday evening in early October , when the leaves have just started to change colours into their bright yellows and vibra nt oranges and deep reds. And Merlin, dressed in a cozy, washe d out red sweater and taller and older than the Merlin that left, sits in front of him, typing away at his laptop. The librar y floor is silent besides the clacking of Merlin’ s keyboard and the occasional flip of a page from across the room where another group of students are sitting, their whispers quiet in the vast open space. It’s way too late to be studying, the world outside the windows dark save for the few streetlights strewn across campus. The rain patters agains t the glass and the occasional leaf falls past, illuminated by the lights from inside and the lamps outside. Arthur didn’t even know Merlin went to the same university as him until Gwen dragged Merlin along to their friend group’ s biweekly Sunday pub-quiz a few weeks ago and Merlin was promptly adopted into the group. Arthur didn’ t need the introduction Gwen gave, could have recognised Merlin anywhere, even when he was taller and older and just that much more pretty . And Merlin didn’ t seem to have any problem recognising him either , judging by the massive and heart-stopping grin he sent Arthur ’s way the moment their eyes met. Arthur thought he was over Merlin, he really did — not as a friend, because no number of years could ever remove how important Merlin has always been, but those nerve-wracking romantic feelings — and yet they’re there, right underneath his breastbone, humming and warm and as solid and real as they’d been the day he left Merlin on the steps to his building four years ago. And in the same way those feelings easily made their way back into Arthur ’s life, so did Merlin, and he’s made himself snug and comfortable as a constant presence that Arthur isn’t sure how he lived without for so long. Lance stretches beside Arthur , his bones cracking satisfyingly , and it reminds Arthur of just how long they’ve been sat here. “I think it’s time for me to head home,” he says, closing his laptop and tucking it into his bag. “I’m pretty sure I’ll do better on the midterms if I actually get some sleep in between study sessions.” Arthur huffs out a laugh and leans back in his chair . He still has an assignment that needs to be submitted by midnight, but he really would love to go back to his own crappy dorm bed. “Sleep is for the weak,” Merlin says, never taking his eyes of f his screen. Arthur and Lance share a look. Arthur shakes his head with a sigh. “I’ll follow you to the cafeteria,” he says and stands up. “I’m going to need cof fee if I want to survive another two hours of this.” “Oh, get me one, will you?” Merlin asks. He’ s still not looking up from his laptop. Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “I’d tell you to get one yourself but I don’t think even a natural disaster could get you to move,” he says. That, at least, gets Merlin to finally look up to grin at him. Lance chuckles, standing up and slinging his bag over his shoulder . “See you tomorrow , Merlin.” “See you tomorrow , Lance. Enjoy your sleep,” Merlin says and turns to grin at him. “I will,” Lance says. “Enjoy your studying.” “I won’ t.” “I’ll make sure he doesn’ t die,” Arthur says, clasping Lance on the shoulder as he walks past him towards the stairs. He doesn’ t miss Merlin poking his tongue out at him, but Arthur is clearly the more mature person here because he stops himself from poking his tongue out right back at him. Lance laughs as he follows him, the sound loud in the quiet space. “And who’ s going to make sure you don’ t?” Arthur grins. “Merlin, of course.” Lance chuckles. “It’ll be a pleasant surprise if I see either of you alive and awake in the morning, then,” he says and squeezes Arthur ’s shoulder . “Try to get some sleep at least.” “We will,” Arthur says as they stop by the small cof fee hub. “T ell Gwen I said hi.” “Will do. Goodnight, Arthur ,” Lance says with a smile. “Night,” Arthur says, waving him off as he leaves the library , and then steps up to the tired- looking student manning the cof fee. It’s only when he orders that he realises he doesn’ t know how Merlin likes his coffee. 16- year-old Merlin didn’ t drink coffee, and Arthur has only known 20-year -old Merlin for a few weeks. So he gets a vegan pumpkin spice latte for himself because he’s a basic bitch and it tastes good, and orders a large black coffee with just a bit of dairy-free-milk for Merlin and hopes it’ll do. That’ s how the Merlin he knew liked his tea. “One large dose of caffeine,” he says as he places the takeaway mug next to Merlin’ s scattered notes. “Oh my god, thank you,” Merlin says, moving the mug to his lips and taking a large gulp without so much as a wince. How he can drink it when it’s still scalding hot Arthur doesn’ t know , but he used to do that with hot chocolate and tea before too. “Oh, this is perfect. Thank you, Arthur ,” he says, grinning at Arthur with a brightness that rivals the bloody sun. Arthur hasn’ t seen Merlin in four years, and somehow it’s like no time has passed at all. He knows he doesn’ t really know this Merlin, this older version of him that has lived a life without Arthur , but he finds that he desperately wants to. Wants to know him in any way Merlin will let him, actually , and for a moment he wonders if this is the moment he should tell him. If it’s time to spill the secrets that are no longer held tightly against his chest but are still held close and only shared with a very select few. Maybe now, almost entirely alone on the third floor of the university library on a wet, dark evening in October , when they’re starting over and continuing on, is when he should let Merlin know how he feels. “Gosh I’m so happy to have you back in my life. I really missed you,” Merlin says, grin soft around the edges, hair tousled just so and looking warm and cozy and like everything Arthur thinks he could ever want. Arthur ’s lips twitch into a smile hidden behind his mug, the steam curling warm around his nose. “No one managed to take my place, then?” he says, and Merlin laughs. “No, you prat. No one’s ego is large enough,” he says. “But no, I’ve only ever had one best friend,” he adds, smile wide and happy and warm, and Arthur doesn’ t want to risk ruining that, or the second chance they’ve been given. So he smiles back and tucks the feelings into the pocket he kept them in for so long before, and says, “Me too.” IV. “Merlin, do you really think this is a good idea? You don’t think it’s a little too.. on the nose?” Arthur asks as he twists and turns in front of the body-length mirror in Merlin’ s flat. It’s not that he doesn’t think he looks good — the costume is very high quality and Arthur is going to have to wear it for every single costume party for the rest of his life with how much it cost — but it feels a little too ridiculous. They’ve been teased about this since they became friends in primary; is it really necessary to add fuel to the flame? “That’ s why it’ s so good!” Merlin calls from the bathroom. Arthur sighs. The things he does for him. “Are you nearly finished or are we going to be three hours late again?” “Yeah yeah, done in a second! This bloody beard doesn’ t want to stick,” Merlin says. “Need any help?” Arthur asks as he tightens the belt around his waist and pulls on his red cape. He grabs the small pink, purpl e, and blue dragon pin from Merlin’ s desk and fiddles with it. It’s his favourite pride pin, given to him by Merlin after he finally gathered up the courage to tell him that he likes people romantically and no one sexua lly, regardless of gender . It still scares him to wear it, despite the pride he feels. He wonders how long it’ll take before it stops making his stomach swoop anxiously , if it ever will stop. “No, all good!” Merlin says, and then he’s bouncing out from the bathroom and Arthur can’t help the loud laugh that escapes him. “You look absolutely ridiculous,” he says. “Remind me to never let you grow a beard.” Merlin pouts at him, and it makes him look even more bizarre in his red robes and long white fake beard and scraggly wig. He’ s even added wrinkles. “Who said Merlin the Wizard had to be old?” Arthur asks, still fiddling with the pin in his hands. “Maybe he was a fit young sorcerer .” Merlin rolls his eyes and steps forward, hands reaching to grab the pin from Arthur ’s hands. He hums as he removes the pin lock. “King Arthur ’s young lover , perhaps?” he says, glancing up briefly at Arthur before he returns his attention to fastening the pin to Arthur ’s cape. Arthur swallows. “W ell, history always did have a way of being pretty gay .” Merlin snorts. “You can say that again.” He finishes fastening the pin, runs his hands over the fabric of the cape, and then steps back. He grins at Arthur . “Now we match,” he says, tugging at his red robes and the bi-coloured butterfly and the non-binary he/him pins fastened on the left side of his chest. Arthur huf fs out a laugh, heart thudding in his chest. “You look great,” Merlin adds, giving him a once-over . “The Great King of Camelot.” “Thanks,” Arthur says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. “Y ou look old.” Merlin rolls his eyes at him again, and really it fits his costume perfectly . “Prat.” “That’ s Your Royal Prat to you, Sorce rer,” Arthur says as he makes sure he has all his things and picks up Merli n’s phone before grabbing hold of Merlin’ s arm. “Now come on, the court awaits us.” Gwaine has really gone all out. His house is decked out with skeletons and ghosts and spider - web, a row of pumpkins that Arthur recognises from their annual pumpkin-carving competition litters his front porch, and the music blasting from the living room is nothing if not the Ghostbusters soundtrack. Gwaine himself is dressed in a leather costume that shows more skin than perhaps is socially acceptable but is entirely expected from him and a winged eyeliner that even Arthur is jealous of even if he very rarely wears makeup. No way the Playboy bunnies are getting all the fun, as Gwai ne said a few years ago when he wore a literal Playboy bunny outfit for Halloween. He’ s only outdone himself since. “Friends! You made it,” he calls when they walk through the door. “I’m loving the couple’ s costume,” he says with a wide grin. Arthur rolls his eyes at him and lets himself be pulled into a mostly naked hug. “Thanks. It was all Merlin’ s idea,” he says when Gwaine pulls Merlin into a similar hug. Gwaine grins at Merlin, slapping him on the shoulder . “Of course it was.” Merlin grins back at him proudly . His fake beard is already starting to peel, so Arthur pushes it back in place. “You want anything to drink?” Gwaine asks, motioning towards the kitchen that is only a little less crowded than the living room and the hall. Arthur shrugs. “Why not.” “I’m alright, thanks. I’m going to find Gwen! I promised her I’d show her my outfit as soon as I came,” Merlin says, waving them off and disappearing into the throng of people and further into the house. “Alright then, what can I offer you, Princess?” Gwaine asks as he leads Arthur into the kitchen. There are orange streamers hanging from the ceiling and the kitchen table is littered with an array of drinks and bottles. Arthur rolls his eyes again. “Honestly , anything’ s fine so long as it’s not deadly . I do have to attend lunch with my father and sister tomorrow , and as much as I think Morgana would love to see me hungover I don’t think Father would be too impressed,” he says, scowling when Gwaine grins at him. “Your daddy’s always been a stick in the mud,” he says, and Arthur scrunc hes his nose up at the choice of word , but can’t disagr ee with the rest. “I’m going to make you a potion of courage so you can finally get around to telling Merlin how you feel. You’ll only feel it a little in the morning , I promise,” he says with a smile that tells Arthur he’s definitely going to feel it more than a little. Arthur purses his lips and gives him an unimpressed glare, but doesn’ t stop him when Gwaine grabs a few of the bottles strewn across the table and starts pouring liquids of different colours into a glass. “Oh, come on, mate. You’ve been pining for him since primary school. Don’ t you think it’s about time?” Honestly Arthur doesn’ t know why he ever told Gwaine about his feelings for Merlin, but then he probably wasn’ t very sober when he did and it was definitely Gwaine and his scarily- tasty, very-alcoholic drinks’ fault. He raises an eyebrow when Gwaine drops a small, round item into his drink and holds it out to him. “And I’m perfectly fine pining until I die,” he says, taking the glass and watching the fake eye bob up and down in the colourful drink. He gives Gwaine a skeptical look before taking a sip. “Oh my god,” he says, making a face. It’ s way too strong and tastes way too good. “What the hell did you put in this?” Gwaine just grins at him and slaps him on the shoulder . “Just think about it,” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen. Arthur doesn’ t tell him that he has thought about it, multiple times. He takes another sip from the drink and grimaces again. God he’s not having any more to drink after this one. Arthur has thought about it, more times than he can count, really , has been close to telling Merlin a handful of times too. And yet, Gwaine’ s words make him think about it again, because honestly he isn’t sure he really is fine pining until the day he dies. He loves being friends with Merlin more than anything and if that’ s what they’re always going to be then that is more than fine with him, but he’s not sure he could go his entire life not knowing if that’s what Merlin wants or if their relationship could be something else. It’s probably the ridiculous amount of alcohol in the drink Gwaine made, but he’s feeling a little daring tonight. He won’ t ever know what Merlin feels if he never asks, right? So he spends almost half an hour walking through Gwaine’ s house trying to find Merlin somewhere in the crowd of witches and superheroes and pirates and ghosts, with little success. But he’ s made up his mind now , and like hell he’ s going to chicken out. It’s only when he goes outside into the cold night air that he spots him in the corner of the garden, face softly illuminated by the string of yellow lights hanging in the red and orange trees. He’s sitting, rather close, too, and laughing with a girl — Freya, Arthur thinks, from one of Merlin’ s nerdy societies. They’re turned towards each other , knees touching and smiles on their faces, caught in conve rsation. They look like they’ve forgotten the rest of the world exists, as if there’ s only the two of them, and Arthur ’s stomach drops. He guesses he wasn’ t meant to tell Merlin today either . He’s just about to turn around and go back inside when Merlin spots him. Merlin turns and grins at him, and Arthur , in turn, just gives him an awkward wave. Merlin turns back to Freya, saying something that has her smiling widely and nodding, and then he ducks in to leave a lingering kiss on her cheek before standing up and making his way towards Arthur . He doesn’ t take his eyes off her until he’s reached him, and Arthur supposes there’ s no need to ask. It’ s plenty obvious what Merlin feels. So, instead, he forces a grin and wiggles his eyebrows when Merlin finally looks at him. Merlin just laughs, cheeks dusted red, and punches him in the arm. V. The tube is crowded, with people packed shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and groups of friends squeezed too many into a row of seats. Arthur is tucked — more like wedged, really — between Merlin and Percival, the rest of their friends crammed in around them. There’ s really no use in trying to follow any of the conversations happening around him with the loud noise of the train and the laughter and chatter filling the car from all directions, and it’s much too tight to get a hold of his phone, so Arthur settles with staring off into the space in front of him. Which happens to hold a glum looking Merlin. It’s not very cold on the tube — the body temperature of all eight hundre d or so people are doing wonders against the early November cold — but Merlin is wrapped up in his usual blue scarf, chin tucked into it, and huddled into a thick rust red jacket. The dark grey wool beanie he’s wear ing has a small cat with a red neckerchief on the brim, his dark hair curling around it. He’s clearly trying to follow whatev er conversation Morgana, Leon, Lance, and Gwen are having on the other side of Percival, but Arthur can barely hear them so he figures Merlin isn’t much better off. He knows why he’s trying though, knows why there’s a small frown pulling at his brow and why there’ s a tired set to his shoulders and bags under his eyes. Arthur wishes he could help, wishes he could cheer him up, get him out of his own head and forget about Freya for a moment, but he’s shit at these things. What do you tell someone who’ s just been broken up with by their year-long girlfriend? Merlin really liked Freya, probably even loved her; what do you say to someone who’ s gotten their heart broken? Arthur isn’t sure he’d want anyone to say anything reassuring to him at all, honestly . It’s all empty words, anyway . So he doesn’ t say anything reassuring. Instead, he says, “Your face is going to get stuck if you keep frowning like that,” because he’ s an idiot. Merlin rolls his eyes at him, but the frown loosens up just the slightest, so Arthur takes it as a win. “You’re one to speak, with how you brood half the time. You’re going to get wrinkles,” Merlin retorts. Arthur gapes at him, af fronted. “I don’ t brood!” Merlin snorts. He squeezes his hand up between them and runs his thumb over Arthur ’s forehead. “Then what’ s this, Mr. Sunshine?” he says, and Arthur immediately tries to relax the scowl he’d barely noticed. “I’m a delight, thank you very much.” Merlin huffs out a laugh, and it’s a little happier , at least. Instead of trying to pull his arm down to his side again, he simply lets it rest against Arthur ’s chest, hand steady on his shoulder . Arthur wonders if Merlin can feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. “You’re about as delightful as the flu,” Merlin tells him. Arthur can’t help himself, and smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “What, getting you all hot and bothered?” he asks, and Merlin lets out a loud, startled laugh. Warmth fills Arthur ’s chest at the look Merlin gives him, his eyes twinkling with mirth. He hasn’ t seen Merlin smile so widely in weeks. He grins crookedly back at him. “You wish,” Merlin says, and becaus e their proximity means he can’t punch Arthur in the arm like he usually would, he resorts to pinching his neck lightly . Arthur complains out loud, and wonders silently if he should admit that yes, he kind of does. “This station is W ood Gr een,” the announcement sounds over the intercom, and as soon as the tube stops almost the entire car fills out into the station. And from there it’s a rush of bodies and excitement and street food and drinks, watching the large bonfire get lit and its fire grow , yelling more than speaking the rhyme, and cheering over the morbid tradition of watching a man made of straw be set on fire. It’s fun and pleasant and the drinks are warm where the night is cold, and they’re all bundled together as close to the fire as they can get. Arthur stands next to Merlin, a cup of hot apple cider in his hands, watchin g from the corner of his eye as Merlin stares absentmindedly into the fire. The light of the bonfire casts shadows and a yellow glow across his face that makes him look ethereal. The quiet content in his eyes has Arthu r’s heart aching in his chest, because Merlin deserves this always, to feel content and happy and cherished. Merlin deserves to know that someone loves him, now more than ever , when he feels broken and unloveable. It’s their final year, and while Arthur doesn’ t think he could let go of Merl in again so easily , they’re graduating soon and life takes turns you don’t expect it to. He might not get another chance, might not gather up the courage again before it’ s too late. “Merlin,” he starts, and Merlin turns to him with a hum, eyes softly crinkled at the corners. His cheeks are a little rosy from the nipping wind, but he looks warm and comfortable and Arthur is so ridiculously in love. Arthur opens his mouth to continue — to tell him, finally — but that’s when the first firework goes off and the world is lit with a wonderful array of colours. Merlin turns his head with a surprised laugh to watch the display in the night sky, but Arthur pays more attention to the way the colours illuminate Merlin’ s face and how they reflect in his wide, awestruck eyes. Merlin’ s face is lit up in delight by the time the colours fade. He turns to Arthur with a blinding smile, and Arthur swallows. Because he can’t risk taking this away from him, not now, not for such selfish reasons as his own. “What were you going to say?” Merlin asks, and Arthur shakes his head. There’ll be another time, a time when Merlin isn’t heart broken and his eyes don’t reflect the night sky, when Arthur can form the words instead of just wanting to stare at him in awe. “Nothing,” he says. “Just… glad you’re here.” Merlin beams at him and bumps their shoulders. He doesn’ t pull away afterwards. “Me too.” + I. It’s a cold, wet Saturday in late Novem ber. The air is cold and the trees are bare, and the day has been lovely , the air crisp and the sky blue — up until about an hour ago. Then lunchtime came around and so did the dark clouds hanging heavy over Arthur ’s head, and of course it would start pouring down the mome nt he stepped out from the safety of the under ground station. As he rushes through the streets in the rain he’s eternally grateful that he had the foresight to bring a raincoat and that Merlin decided on meeting for a coffee rather than the walk he first suggested. A bell jingles as he pushes the door to The Round Table open and steps inside, coat dripping water onto the floor despite the short trip from the station to the café. He pulls the hood down and unzips the coat as he glances around the small and cozy space. It’s of little surprise that Merlin is nowhere to be seen; he does have a penchant for being late. Arthur decides to order while he waits, and scans over the menus above the bar. They’re all changed from their autumn and Halloween specials to limited winter and Christmas drinks, and the shelves are lined with yule logs, Christmas puddings, and fruity mince pies amongst their usual pastries and cakes. The only thing that’s missing, really , is the Christmas decoration and All I Want For Christmas Is You playing from the speakers, but Arthur figures it’s probably only a matter of days. He doesn ’t dislike Christmas per se, but he doesn’ t usually try to get himself into the Christmas spirit until December 1st, so he’s happy to see they still offer their autumn assortment. He orders a vegan caramel and hazelnut latte and a black coffee with a splash of dairy-free milk and a pinch of cinnam on. Just as he’s about to pay he throws in one of the gingerbread muffins too because he can’t help himself. It’s only a week until December , anyway . He’s just sat down with the drinks and the pastry when the bell above the door jingles again, a mop of wet, dark hair and dark blue eyes looking around until they spot him. Merlin grins widely and makes his way through the café. The corner of Arthur ’s mouth tugs up just the slightest. “Sorry I’m late!” Merlin says when he reaches him, and he does at least have the decency to look like he means it. “I forgot my umbrella at home and was hoping I could wait out the rain at the station,” he says as he shrugs off his wet coat and hangs it over the chair in front of Arthur . His hair is dripping water onto his dark green sweater and his cheeks are flushed a bright red from the cold. Arthur rolls his eyes good heartedly . “Only you, Merlin.” “That’ s not true!” Merlin exclaims, ruffling his hair and successfully splattering water droplets everywhere. “The forecast didn’ t say anything about a downpour!” “It did say it was going to rain,” Arthur points out. Merlin rolls his eyes as he steps aroun d the table. “It didn’ t say it was going to rain this much . Clotpole,” he says, and then he bends down and pulls Arthur into a tight, warm — if a little wet — hug. “I missed you.” Arthur wraps his arms around Merlin’ s back and hugs him back just as tightly . It’s only been a few months, and it’s not like they haven’ t talked, but between internships and work and Merlin being away as part of his graduate position, they’ve barely had any time to meet since graduation. And Arthur has missed him something fiercely . “We talked yesterday ,” he says, just to be an arse, and Merlin huffs out a laugh and hugs him just a little tighter . Arthur grins. “I missed you too.” Merlin squeezes him one more time and then he pulls back, plopping into his chair and pulling his waiting cup of coffee towards him. He takes a sip and hums satisfied, his lips pulling into a grin. The corners of it are soft and warm. “So, what ’s happened in your life? I want to know everything,” he says, leaning his elbows against the table. Arthur huffs out a laugh and takes a sip from his own warm drink. “You already know everything,” he says. “Nothing new has happened in the last eighteen hours, surprisingly enough.” Merlin just continues to grin at him. “How was the Halloween party?” “Good,” Arthur says. “Gwaine and Percy fell into the pool and Leon had to pull them out. They were both grounded and forced to spend the rest of the night sobering up in Gwaine’ s bathroom,” he tells him with a chuck le. “And Gwen looked so gorgeous in her costume we all thought Lance was going to get down and propose any second.” He grins. “Although I think he’ s probably got something a little more special planned.” Merlin chuckles. “Maybe not the most romantic situation when people are dressed up in outfits ranging from nothing to absolute absurdity and everyone is well beyond drunk. Good choice, Lance.” “I’m pretty sure Gwen would say yes if he proposed in a dumpster , to be fair .” Merlin laughs, warm and happy . “Yeah, she would.” “My costume wasn’ t nearly as good without my sorcerer , though,” Arthur says, and Merlin smiles widely . “I’m sure the mighty King Arthur is just as striking without him,” he says. Arthur shrugs. “Maybe,” he says, hiding his smile behind his cup. “But he definitely felt like something was missing.” Merlin’ s bright eyes crinkle at the corners. “I guess his sorcerer will have to make sure to show up next time, then,” he says. “I’m holding you to that,” Arthur says, giving him a pointed look. “So, how was Manchester? Seemed like you had a lot of fun.” Merlin’ s entire face lights up. “I did! It was so interesting to finally see everything I’ve learnt actually be used in practice, you know?” he says, and then he goes on a ramble about everything he saw in the three months he was away , everyone he met, all the things he got to do. Arthur has already heard more than half of this, but he has only heard it over the phone and through video calls with poor connection, and he’ll never mind hearing Merlin speak, no matter how many times he has to hear the same thing. A little distance and four months apart and the feelings in Arthur ’s chest haven’ t diminished in the slightest. At this point he figures they probably never will. “-and Sefa has promised to come here just before Christmas; we were thinking of heading up to Edinbur gh for the Christmas market. I’m just really excited to see her again, even if we saw each other a few weeks ago,” Merlin says with a laugh. He speaks about her a lot, Sefa, and it’ s clear he likes her . Arthur just isn’ t sure in which way . So he raises his eyebrow suggestively , and Merlin’ s quick to wave him of f. “No, it’s nothing like that,” he says with a chuckle. “We’re friends, and I’m pretty sure she and Daegal have something going on,” he adds and grins. Arthur nods in understanding, but frowns when Merlin gives him a funny look. “How about you?” Merlin asks, averting his eyes and grabbing one of the forks on the table. He pokes at the gingerbread muffin. “Mithian seems nice,” he says, and there’ s a strange tilt to his voice. And sure, Mithian is nice. Quite lovely , actually , and Arthur could see something happening between them, if he wasn’ t so damn gone on the person sitting in front of him. And so, this time, Arthur doesn’ t hesitate, doesn’ t stop himself or let himself back down. This time, he lets the words he’s wanted to say for so long roll off his tongue with an ease that really isn’ t all that surprising. “She is,” Merlin’ s lips tug up into something that is probably supposed to be a smile but looks more like a grimace, “but I’m far too busy pining over my best friend for the nth year in a row to really consider it.” It feels not so scary and very relievin g, to finally share the secret he never wanted to keep to begin with. Merlin snaps his head up to stare at him with wide eyes and Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “Oh come on, you can’ t be that oblivious.” Merlin huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “No. I just wasn’ t expecting you to actually admit it,” he says, and Arthur frowns at him. “I’ve been waiting for you to say something since we were fifteen.” Arthur balks. “Why did you wait for me to say something? If you knew , why didn’ t you say so?” Merlin shrugs, shoving a piece of muffin into his mouth. “I didn’ t want to force you to share something you weren’ t ready for, or feel like you were obligated to do anything about it. I know your dad isn’ t…” he grimaces, “the most approving.” Arthur snorts. “No shit. But seriously , since year ten?” he asks, and Merlin nods. Arthur huffs out a laugh, and leans back in his chair . “Guess all my anxiety about telling you was pretty unnecessary .” Merlin gives him a soft smile. “Y ou never needed to be anxious.” “I know ,” Arthur says with a sigh. “I’ve wanted you to know since I figured it out, but it always came up at bad times or something came in the way and ruined the moment,” he says. Merlin laughs. “But at a café on a random, miserable Saturday afternoon fit the bill?” he asks, mirth in his eyes. Arthur pushes down his own grin and shrugs. “Figured it was as good a day as any .” “Say it again,” Merlin says, leaning forward in his chair , his lips stretching wide as he smiles. Arthur rolls his eyes at him, but he feels his smile tug at his own cheeks. “I love you.” “I know that,” Merlin says with laughter in his voice. “Say the other thing,” he tells him. Arthur huf fs out a breath of a laugh and moves forwards so he’ s also leaning over the table. “I’m in love with you,” he says, holding Merlin’ s gaze. He doesn’ t bother fighting the smile anymore. “Have been since I was eleven.” Merlin grins, wide and bright and warm, and then he ducks forward and his lips catch Arthur ’s in a kiss that tastes like cinnamon and coffee and caramel. It is new and exciting just the same as it feels entirely natural, like something Arthur has done a hundred times before, something he’ll do hundreds and hundreds of times again. “Good,” Merlin says when he pulls away . “Because I’m in love with you too and I’d really like to add ‘boyfriend’ to the list of things I refer to you as in my head.” Arthur runs a thumb over Merlin’ s cheekbone and raises an eyebrow . He probably shouldn’ t ask, but he can’ t help himself. “Oh? And what other names do you have on that list?” “Clotpoll. Prat. Best friend. Ass. Arthur . Cabbagehead. Love of my life. Dollophead.” He laughs and kisses Merlin again. “Wouldn’ t be a complete list without boyfriend on there, would it?” Merlin grins at him again, bright and warm enough to rival the sun. “No, no it wouldn’ t.” End Notes Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!

                <div class="summary">Arthur figures out that he&#x27;s in love with Merlin when he&#x27;s 1 1. It takes him more than a decade to finally tell him. Or: Five times Arthur wants to tell Merlin and one time he does. Notes This fic really fought me at every turn; first I couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea, and then I wasn&#x27;t in the mood, and then when I actually sat down and to write it would only come out by heavy force. But I’ve written and posted an autumn inspired fic every year since 2017 and I wasn’ t about to stop now . You couldn’ t best me, fic. (I’m actually pretty happy with how it turned out, all struggles considered!) For those of you who aren’ t familiar with the English school system, students are 1 1/12 years old in year 7 and 16/17 in sixth form! Also big thanks to the best Joji-san for sensitivity beta-ing Merlin for me!&lt;3 See the end of the work for more notes I. It’s early September and the days are not quite as warm as they’ve been. Arthur usually resents the coming of the cold, but this year he can’t help but grin when he pulls on his jacket over his school uniform. It’s not that he particularly likes the cold, but frigid and foggy mornings mean that the autumn term is finally starting and Arthur has looked forward to it since last semester ended. He loves the summer holidays and usually hates for them to end, but this year he hasn’ t been able to stop himself from wishing they would just be over already; he likes school well enough — he really likes learning about histor y and the sciences — but that’s not why he’s been almost bursting with excitement about going back. What’ s really been keeping him restless and eager the past few weeks has been the knowledge that with the start of the school term, comes meeting Merlin again. Arthur hasn’ t seen his best friend since the start of the summer , since Merlin has been away visiting family , and the summer has been dreadfully boring without him. Arthur is so excited to see him again he’s certain he’s been getting on his fathe r and sister ’s nerves with it — not that it stopped him from bouncing around the house this morning in his haste to get ready . And now, finally , he’s on his way to the first day of school for year seven. He’d be running if Morgana wasn’ t walking — like a snail because she’ s evil — with him. Arthur jumps up and down in his place on a pile of green leaves as he waits for her to catch up — she might as well crawl with how slowly she’ s walking. “Stop grinning like that,” she says with a roll of her eyes. “One would think you have a crush on him,” she adds and smirks. Arthur stops and scrunches his nose up. “I don’ t have a crush. Crushes are gross.” Morgana grins at him. “Sure, whatever . Just let me know if you need any help asking him to be your boyfriend,” she says as she walks past him. “I don’t want him to be my boyfrien d,” Arthur says with a frown as he falls into step with her. “I want him to be my friend.” “He can be both, you dummy ,” Mor gana tells him. “That’ s why it’ s called boy friend .” That makes Arthur pause in his steps, before he shakes his head and runs up to walk beside her again. “It’s a girl thing to have crushes,” he says. He knows Elena talked about having crushes on some of the boys in year seven when they were still in year six, but he’s never heard any of his boy friends say anything about crushes. “And I’m not a girl.” Morgana snorts. “Then why did Father marry your mother?” she retorts. Arthur frowns in thought. He supposes that’s true, but he’s never had a crush before! Why would he have one on Merlin ? Aren’ t boys supposed to have crushes on girls, anyway? “But Merlin’ s not a girl either ,” he says, and Morgana pats him patronising ly on the shoulder because she thinks she knows so much more than he does just because she’ s two years older . “Doesn’ t mean you can’t like him,” she says, and then she shoves him in old evil-sister - fashion, because apparently Arthur got so lost in his thoughts that he didn’ t notice they’d already reached the school. “See you later, brother!” she says, and then skips up the steps to meet her friends and leaves Arthur with a bunch of unanswered questions. Arthur frowns at her . Stupid Mor gana and her stupid friends. “Arthur!” He turns around at the sound of his name, grins widely when he spots Merlin — who is wrapped up in an oversized jacket and wears a neckerchief around his neck, even if it’ s barely below fifteen degrees outside, because he gets cold even when it’s not really all that chilly — and for gets all about crushes and Mor gana. He forgets it for a few hours, until lunch, when Merlin laughs loudly at Gwaine’ s stupid joke and Arthur ’s stomach flutters as if there are falling leaves or butterflies inside it. His eyes widen and he stops with his fork midway to his mouth. Maybe Morgana was right. Maybe he does want Merlin to be his boyfriend. For the rest of the day, Arthur can’t stop thinking about it, about how Merlin is kind of cute with his rosy cheeks and oversized jacket and clumsy boots, about how maybe Arthur wouldn’ t be so opposed to holding his hand, about how he would quite like to introduce Merlin as his ‘best friend and boyfriend’. Which means it’s become a thing that Arthur actually thinks might be true, which means that he has to tell Merlin about it, because they tell each other everything and Arthur isn’t about to start keeping secrets now. Only , he isn’t sure how to tell him. He’s not going to ask Morgana for help because she’s a witch who wants nothing but for Arthur to suffer, but who better to ask than his father , who is wise and smart and knows how everything works? So instead of going back to his room after dinner like he usually does, he follows his father to his office and stops outside it, rocking back and forth on his heels. His father’s office is dark mahogany and warm leather , and Arthur has always felt both intimidated and awed by it. “What is it, Arthur?” his father asks from his old leather chair , the evening paper in his hands. “Did everything go well at school today?” Arthur stops rocking on his feet and nods. “Y es, Father , it was fine,” he says. “I was, uhm..” “Hesitation is not a desirable or respectable trait, Arthur . You should know better ,” his father says, not looking up from the paper . Arthur swallows, and then squares his shoulders. “You know Merlin,” he says, and his father arches an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “W ell, I, uh- think I like him.” He means to go on, but his father looks up at him with a disapproving frow n that has Arthur snapping his mouth shut. “That’ s nonsense. Where did you get that idea?” he asks, and Arthur ’s shoulders hitch up just the slightest at the same time his stomach drops. “Uh- well, Mor gana said-“ His father scoffs. “Don’ t listen to your sister , she’s just trying to rile you up. You don’t like Merlin. Get that ridiculous notion out of your head. He’s a boy and so are you,” he states, returning his focus to the paper . “Now , was there anything else?” “Erm, no, uh, thank you,” Arthur says in a small voice. There’ s a lump in his throat and an uncomfortable feeling in his chest. His father dismisses him with a wave of his hand and Arthur quickly hurries to his room to bury himself under his duvet. Rain patters against his window . He suddenly feels very certain that he does have a crush on Merlin, and that he absolutely cannot tell him. II. The night air is chilly and wet, the late September rain filling the potholes in the road and leaving puddles on the pavement. The street lights flicker and the headlights of a passing car reflect in the pools of water , before the car drives through them and ruins it. There’ s a gale coming, the winds pulling at their clothes and nipping at their cheeks, the gloomy clouds rolling above their heads. Arthur blinks the wetness from his eyes and wipes the raindrop from his cheek and thinks that even the weather is miserable. He huddles into his worn hoodie in an attempt to stay warm, but even the heat from Merlin’ s leg pressed against his isn’t helping to stave off the early autumn chill. Arthur feels cold to the bone, and not just because of the wind that pushes cold air into the collar of his hoodie. They’ve started sixth form and it’s supposed to be exciting and fun and new, but all Arthur feels is lousy . “I don’t want you to leave,” he mutters into his collar . It’s quiet and petulant and just the slightest bit angry , and Arthur doesn’ t care. He is angry , angry at Merlin for just up and leaving him like this with next to no warning. Only a few weeks ago things were great and Arthur was excited to start this new part of his life, and then Merlin went and told him he’s moving and everything turned horrible. Merlin sighs next to him, wrapped up in his thick jacket and the wool scarf Arthur knows his mother knitted him for Christmas two years ago; Arthur has a matching one, red to Merlin’ s blue. His cheeks are rosy red from the cold and his eyes are sad, their blue almost black in the dark of the night. “Me neither ,” he mumbles, burying his chin further into his scarf. “But with Mum’ s health we need to be closer to family and we can’t exactly ask them all to come to London, now can we?” he says with a laugh, but it sounds hollow in the dim street. Arthur doesn’t answer, because there really isn’t anything he can say, is there? It’s not like Merlin has a choice and Arthur can’t exactly demand that he leave his mother while she’s sick, no matter how much he wants him to stay . Merlin sighs again, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. “I’m going to miss it here,” he says. A smile pulls at his lips as he watches the wet street and the dark park on the other side of it. “Remember when we were ten and we climbed the big tree and I broke my arm?” he asks, the corners of his eyes scrunching up just the slightest. As if Arthur could forget; he’d gotten a right heart attack, seeing Merlin cry and clutch his arm to his chest in pain. “The scolding from Mum was almost worse than the pain,” Merlin contin ues with a laugh, and this one, at least, is real, if a little wet. He sniffles, grinning widely , and turns to Arthur . “But you were there the whole time — you wouldn’ t even leave the hospital. Told me stories about knights and sorcerers and drago ns to keep me distracted, and then you demanded that you got to write on my cast and you wrote your name so large no one else could fit theirs, like the self-entitled prat you are.” His smile softens into something a little sadder , and Arthur hates this so much. Hates saying goodbye. Doesn’ t even know if he knows how to. Merlin glances back at the clouds and the stars just starting to peek through them. “I’m going to miss you,” he says, quietly , and Arthur thinks about telling him, then. About the feelings he’s been pushing away since he was eleven and his father told him he wasn’ t allowed to have them. About the flutters and the want and the maybe-I’m-in-love-with-you. Because this is Merlin and if he can’t tell Merlin then who could he ever hope to tell? If he can’t share this secret with Merlin — this secret that’s overwhelming and large and scary — then he doesn’ t think he can share it with anyone, and he’s not sure he can live with that. And he doesn’ t know when — if — he’ll see Merlin again, so if not now , when? But the words are too heavy in his chest and too big to travel through his throat and Arthur is too afraid and swallows them back down. “I say good riddan ce,” he says instea d, knocking their shoulders together , because it’s easier than being vulnerable and he knows Merlin will get what he means anyway . Merlin grins at him, wet and sad and Arthur hates that he’s leaving. Hates that this is goodbye, even if neither of them actually says the word. “Prat.” III. Arthur and Merlin lose touch sometim e during the spring after Merlin leaves — because it’s difficult to keep in touch even when you really want to when you’re seventeen and everything around you is changing — and Arthur doesn’ t really expect for that to change. He certainly doesn’ t expect to find Merlin back in his life just a month into his first year at university , but here he is, sitting in the university library on a dark, wet Thursday evening in early October , when the leaves have just started to change colours into their bright yellows and vibra nt oranges and deep reds. And Merlin, dressed in a cozy, washe d out red sweater and taller and older than the Merlin that left, sits in front of him, typing away at his laptop. The librar y floor is silent besides the clacking of Merlin’ s keyboard and the occasional flip of a page from across the room where another group of students are sitting, their whispers quiet in the vast open space. It’s way too late to be studying, the world outside the windows dark save for the few streetlights strewn across campus. The rain patters agains t the glass and the occasional leaf falls past, illuminated by the lights from inside and the lamps outside. Arthur didn’t even know Merlin went to the same university as him until Gwen dragged Merlin along to their friend group’ s biweekly Sunday pub-quiz a few weeks ago and Merlin was promptly adopted into the group. Arthur didn’ t need the introduction Gwen gave, could have recognised Merlin anywhere, even when he was taller and older and just that much more pretty . And Merlin didn’ t seem to have any problem recognising him either , judging by the massive and heart-stopping grin he sent Arthur ’s way the moment their eyes met. Arthur thought he was over Merlin, he really did — not as a friend, because no number of years could ever remove how important Merlin has always been, but those nerve-wracking romantic feelings — and yet they’re there, right underneath his breastbone, humming and warm and as solid and real as they’d been the day he left Merlin on the steps to his building four years ago. And in the same way those feelings easily made their way back into Arthur ’s life, so did Merlin, and he’s made himself snug and comfortable as a constant presence that Arthur isn’t sure how he lived without for so long. Lance stretches beside Arthur , his bones cracking satisfyingly , and it reminds Arthur of just how long they’ve been sat here. “I think it’s time for me to head home,” he says, closing his laptop and tucking it into his bag. “I’m pretty sure I’ll do better on the midterms if I actually get some sleep in between study sessions.” Arthur huffs out a laugh and leans back in his chair . He still has an assignment that needs to be submitted by midnight, but he really would love to go back to his own crappy dorm bed. “Sleep is for the weak,” Merlin says, never taking his eyes of f his screen. Arthur and Lance share a look. Arthur shakes his head with a sigh. “I’ll follow you to the cafeteria,” he says and stands up. “I’m going to need cof fee if I want to survive another two hours of this.” “Oh, get me one, will you?” Merlin asks. He’ s still not looking up from his laptop. Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “I’d tell you to get one yourself but I don’t think even a natural disaster could get you to move,” he says. That, at least, gets Merlin to finally look up to grin at him. Lance chuckles, standing up and slinging his bag over his shoulder . “See you tomorrow , Merlin.” “See you tomorrow , Lance. Enjoy your sleep,” Merlin says and turns to grin at him. “I will,” Lance says. “Enjoy your studying.” “I won’ t.” “I’ll make sure he doesn’ t die,” Arthur says, clasping Lance on the shoulder as he walks past him towards the stairs. He doesn’ t miss Merlin poking his tongue out at him, but Arthur is clearly the more mature person here because he stops himself from poking his tongue out right back at him. Lance laughs as he follows him, the sound loud in the quiet space. “And who’ s going to make sure you don’ t?” Arthur grins. “Merlin, of course.” Lance chuckles. “It’ll be a pleasant surprise if I see either of you alive and awake in the morning, then,” he says and squeezes Arthur ’s shoulder . “Try to get some sleep at least.” “We will,” Arthur says as they stop by the small cof fee hub. “T ell Gwen I said hi.” “Will do. Goodnight, Arthur ,” Lance says with a smile. “Night,” Arthur says, waving him off as he leaves the library , and then steps up to the tired- looking student manning the cof fee. It’s only when he orders that he realises he doesn’ t know how Merlin likes his coffee. 16- year-old Merlin didn’ t drink coffee, and Arthur has only known 20-year -old Merlin for a few weeks. So he gets a vegan pumpkin spice latte for himself because he’s a basic bitch and it tastes good, and orders a large black coffee with just a bit of dairy-free-milk for Merlin and hopes it’ll do. That’ s how the Merlin he knew liked his tea. “One large dose of caffeine,” he says as he places the takeaway mug next to Merlin’ s scattered notes. “Oh my god, thank you,” Merlin says, moving the mug to his lips and taking a large gulp without so much as a wince. How he can drink it when it’s still scalding hot Arthur doesn’ t know , but he used to do that with hot chocolate and tea before too. “Oh, this is perfect. Thank you, Arthur ,” he says, grinning at Arthur with a brightness that rivals the bloody sun. Arthur hasn’ t seen Merlin in four years, and somehow it’s like no time has passed at all. He knows he doesn’ t really know this Merlin, this older version of him that has lived a life without Arthur , but he finds that he desperately wants to. Wants to know him in any way Merlin will let him, actually , and for a moment he wonders if this is the moment he should tell him. If it’s time to spill the secrets that are no longer held tightly against his chest but are still held close and only shared with a very select few. Maybe now, almost entirely alone on the third floor of the university library on a wet, dark evening in October , when they’re starting over and continuing on, is when he should let Merlin know how he feels. “Gosh I’m so happy to have you back in my life. I really missed you,” Merlin says, grin soft around the edges, hair tousled just so and looking warm and cozy and like everything Arthur thinks he could ever want. Arthur ’s lips twitch into a smile hidden behind his mug, the steam curling warm around his nose. “No one managed to take my place, then?” he says, and Merlin laughs. “No, you prat. No one’s ego is large enough,” he says. “But no, I’ve only ever had one best friend,” he adds, smile wide and happy and warm, and Arthur doesn’ t want to risk ruining that, or the second chance they’ve been given. So he smiles back and tucks the feelings into the pocket he kept them in for so long before, and says, “Me too.” IV. “Merlin, do you really think this is a good idea? You don’t think it’s a little too.. on the nose?” Arthur asks as he twists and turns in front of the body-length mirror in Merlin’ s flat. It’s not that he doesn’t think he looks good — the costume is very high quality and Arthur is going to have to wear it for every single costume party for the rest of his life with how much it cost — but it feels a little too ridiculous. They’ve been teased about this since they became friends in primary; is it really necessary to add fuel to the flame? “That’ s why it’ s so good!” Merlin calls from the bathroom. Arthur sighs. The things he does for him. “Are you nearly finished or are we going to be three hours late again?” “Yeah yeah, done in a second! This bloody beard doesn’ t want to stick,” Merlin says. “Need any help?” Arthur asks as he tightens the belt around his waist and pulls on his red cape. He grabs the small pink, purpl e, and blue dragon pin from Merlin’ s desk and fiddles with it. It’s his favourite pride pin, given to him by Merlin after he finally gathered up the courage to tell him that he likes people romantically and no one sexua lly, regardless of gender . It still scares him to wear it, despite the pride he feels. He wonders how long it’ll take before it stops making his stomach swoop anxiously , if it ever will stop. “No, all good!” Merlin says, and then he’s bouncing out from the bathroom and Arthur can’t help the loud laugh that escapes him. “You look absolutely ridiculous,” he says. “Remind me to never let you grow a beard.” Merlin pouts at him, and it makes him look even more bizarre in his red robes and long white fake beard and scraggly wig. He’ s even added wrinkles. “Who said Merlin the Wizard had to be old?” Arthur asks, still fiddling with the pin in his hands. “Maybe he was a fit young sorcerer .” Merlin rolls his eyes and steps forward, hands reaching to grab the pin from Arthur ’s hands. He hums as he removes the pin lock. “King Arthur ’s young lover , perhaps?” he says, glancing up briefly at Arthur before he returns his attention to fastening the pin to Arthur ’s cape. Arthur swallows. “W ell, history always did have a way of being pretty gay .” Merlin snorts. “You can say that again.” He finishes fastening the pin, runs his hands over the fabric of the cape, and then steps back. He grins at Arthur . “Now we match,” he says, tugging at his red robes and the bi-coloured butterfly and the non-binary he/him pins fastened on the left side of his chest. Arthur huf fs out a laugh, heart thudding in his chest. “You look great,” Merlin adds, giving him a once-over . “The Great King of Camelot.” “Thanks,” Arthur says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. “Y ou look old.” Merlin rolls his eyes at him again, and really it fits his costume perfectly . “Prat.” “That’ s Your Royal Prat to you, Sorce rer,” Arthur says as he makes sure he has all his things and picks up Merli n’s phone before grabbing hold of Merlin’ s arm. “Now come on, the court awaits us.” Gwaine has really gone all out. His house is decked out with skeletons and ghosts and spider - web, a row of pumpkins that Arthur recognises from their annual pumpkin-carving competition litters his front porch, and the music blasting from the living room is nothing if not the Ghostbusters soundtrack. Gwaine himself is dressed in a leather costume that shows more skin than perhaps is socially acceptable but is entirely expected from him and a winged eyeliner that even Arthur is jealous of even if he very rarely wears makeup. No way the Playboy bunnies are getting all the fun, as Gwai ne said a few years ago when he wore a literal Playboy bunny outfit for Halloween. He’ s only outdone himself since. “Friends! You made it,” he calls when they walk through the door. “I’m loving the couple’ s costume,” he says with a wide grin. Arthur rolls his eyes at him and lets himself be pulled into a mostly naked hug. “Thanks. It was all Merlin’ s idea,” he says when Gwaine pulls Merlin into a similar hug. Gwaine grins at Merlin, slapping him on the shoulder . “Of course it was.” Merlin grins back at him proudly . His fake beard is already starting to peel, so Arthur pushes it back in place. “You want anything to drink?” Gwaine asks, motioning towards the kitchen that is only a little less crowded than the living room and the hall. Arthur shrugs. “Why not.” “I’m alright, thanks. I’m going to find Gwen! I promised her I’d show her my outfit as soon as I came,” Merlin says, waving them off and disappearing into the throng of people and further into the house. “Alright then, what can I offer you, Princess?” Gwaine asks as he leads Arthur into the kitchen. There are orange streamers hanging from the ceiling and the kitchen table is littered with an array of drinks and bottles. Arthur rolls his eyes again. “Honestly , anything’ s fine so long as it’s not deadly . I do have to attend lunch with my father and sister tomorrow , and as much as I think Morgana would love to see me hungover I don’t think Father would be too impressed,” he says, scowling when Gwaine grins at him. “Your daddy’s always been a stick in the mud,” he says, and Arthur scrunc hes his nose up at the choice of word , but can’t disagr ee with the rest. “I’m going to make you a potion of courage so you can finally get around to telling Merlin how you feel. You’ll only feel it a little in the morning , I promise,” he says with a smile that tells Arthur he’s definitely going to feel it more than a little. Arthur purses his lips and gives him an unimpressed glare, but doesn’ t stop him when Gwaine grabs a few of the bottles strewn across the table and starts pouring liquids of different colours into a glass. “Oh, come on, mate. You’ve been pining for him since primary school. Don’ t you think it’s about time?” Honestly Arthur doesn’ t know why he ever told Gwaine about his feelings for Merlin, but then he probably wasn’ t very sober when he did and it was definitely Gwaine and his scarily- tasty, very-alcoholic drinks’ fault. He raises an eyebrow when Gwaine drops a small, round item into his drink and holds it out to him. “And I’m perfectly fine pining until I die,” he says, taking the glass and watching the fake eye bob up and down in the colourful drink. He gives Gwaine a skeptical look before taking a sip. “Oh my god,” he says, making a face. It’ s way too strong and tastes way too good. “What the hell did you put in this?” Gwaine just grins at him and slaps him on the shoulder . “Just think about it,” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen. Arthur doesn’ t tell him that he has thought about it, multiple times. He takes another sip from the drink and grimaces again. God he’s not having any more to drink after this one. Arthur has thought about it, more times than he can count, really , has been close to telling Merlin a handful of times too. And yet, Gwaine’ s words make him think about it again, because honestly he isn’t sure he really is fine pining until the day he dies. He loves being friends with Merlin more than anything and if that’ s what they’re always going to be then that is more than fine with him, but he’s not sure he could go his entire life not knowing if that’s what Merlin wants or if their relationship could be something else. It’s probably the ridiculous amount of alcohol in the drink Gwaine made, but he’s feeling a little daring tonight. He won’ t ever know what Merlin feels if he never asks, right? So he spends almost half an hour walking through Gwaine’ s house trying to find Merlin somewhere in the crowd of witches and superheroes and pirates and ghosts, with little success. But he’ s made up his mind now , and like hell he’ s going to chicken out. It’s only when he goes outside into the cold night air that he spots him in the corner of the garden, face softly illuminated by the string of yellow lights hanging in the red and orange trees. He’s sitting, rather close, too, and laughing with a girl — Freya, Arthur thinks, from one of Merlin’ s nerdy societies. They’re turned towards each other , knees touching and smiles on their faces, caught in conve rsation. They look like they’ve forgotten the rest of the world exists, as if there’ s only the two of them, and Arthur ’s stomach drops. He guesses he wasn’ t meant to tell Merlin today either . He’s just about to turn around and go back inside when Merlin spots him. Merlin turns and grins at him, and Arthur , in turn, just gives him an awkward wave. Merlin turns back to Freya, saying something that has her smiling widely and nodding, and then he ducks in to leave a lingering kiss on her cheek before standing up and making his way towards Arthur . He doesn’ t take his eyes off her until he’s reached him, and Arthur supposes there’ s no need to ask. It’ s plenty obvious what Merlin feels. So, instead, he forces a grin and wiggles his eyebrows when Merlin finally looks at him. Merlin just laughs, cheeks dusted red, and punches him in the arm. V. The tube is crowded, with people packed shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and groups of friends squeezed too many into a row of seats. Arthur is tucked — more like wedged, really — between Merlin and Percival, the rest of their friends crammed in around them. There’ s really no use in trying to follow any of the conversations happening around him with the loud noise of the train and the laughter and chatter filling the car from all directions, and it’s much too tight to get a hold of his phone, so Arthur settles with staring off into the space in front of him. Which happens to hold a glum looking Merlin. It’s not very cold on the tube — the body temperature of all eight hundre d or so people are doing wonders against the early November cold — but Merlin is wrapped up in his usual blue scarf, chin tucked into it, and huddled into a thick rust red jacket. The dark grey wool beanie he’s wear ing has a small cat with a red neckerchief on the brim, his dark hair curling around it. He’s clearly trying to follow whatev er conversation Morgana, Leon, Lance, and Gwen are having on the other side of Percival, but Arthur can barely hear them so he figures Merlin isn’t much better off. He knows why he’s trying though, knows why there’s a small frown pulling at his brow and why there’ s a tired set to his shoulders and bags under his eyes. Arthur wishes he could help, wishes he could cheer him up, get him out of his own head and forget about Freya for a moment, but he’s shit at these things. What do you tell someone who’ s just been broken up with by their year-long girlfriend? Merlin really liked Freya, probably even loved her; what do you say to someone who’ s gotten their heart broken? Arthur isn’t sure he’d want anyone to say anything reassuring to him at all, honestly . It’s all empty words, anyway . So he doesn’ t say anything reassuring. Instead, he says, “Your face is going to get stuck if you keep frowning like that,” because he’ s an idiot. Merlin rolls his eyes at him, but the frown loosens up just the slightest, so Arthur takes it as a win. “You’re one to speak, with how you brood half the time. You’re going to get wrinkles,” Merlin retorts. Arthur gapes at him, af fronted. “I don’ t brood!” Merlin snorts. He squeezes his hand up between them and runs his thumb over Arthur ’s forehead. “Then what’ s this, Mr. Sunshine?” he says, and Arthur immediately tries to relax the scowl he’d barely noticed. “I’m a delight, thank you very much.” Merlin huffs out a laugh, and it’s a little happier , at least. Instead of trying to pull his arm down to his side again, he simply lets it rest against Arthur ’s chest, hand steady on his shoulder . Arthur wonders if Merlin can feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. “You’re about as delightful as the flu,” Merlin tells him. Arthur can’t help himself, and smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “What, getting you all hot and bothered?” he asks, and Merlin lets out a loud, startled laugh. Warmth fills Arthur ’s chest at the look Merlin gives him, his eyes twinkling with mirth. He hasn’ t seen Merlin smile so widely in weeks. He grins crookedly back at him. “You wish,” Merlin says, and becaus e their proximity means he can’t punch Arthur in the arm like he usually would, he resorts to pinching his neck lightly . Arthur complains out loud, and wonders silently if he should admit that yes, he kind of does. “This station is W ood Gr een,” the announcement sounds over the intercom, and as soon as the tube stops almost the entire car fills out into the station. And from there it’s a rush of bodies and excitement and street food and drinks, watching the large bonfire get lit and its fire grow , yelling more than speaking the rhyme, and cheering over the morbid tradition of watching a man made of straw be set on fire. It’s fun and pleasant and the drinks are warm where the night is cold, and they’re all bundled together as close to the fire as they can get. Arthur stands next to Merlin, a cup of hot apple cider in his hands, watchin g from the corner of his eye as Merlin stares absentmindedly into the fire. The light of the bonfire casts shadows and a yellow glow across his face that makes him look ethereal. The quiet content in his eyes has Arthu r’s heart aching in his chest, because Merlin deserves this always, to feel content and happy and cherished. Merlin deserves to know that someone loves him, now more than ever , when he feels broken and unloveable. It’s their final year, and while Arthur doesn’ t think he could let go of Merl in again so easily , they’re graduating soon and life takes turns you don’t expect it to. He might not get another chance, might not gather up the courage again before it’ s too late. “Merlin,” he starts, and Merlin turns to him with a hum, eyes softly crinkled at the corners. His cheeks are a little rosy from the nipping wind, but he looks warm and comfortable and Arthur is so ridiculously in love. Arthur opens his mouth to continue — to tell him, finally — but that’s when the first firework goes off and the world is lit with a wonderful array of colours. Merlin turns his head with a surprised laugh to watch the display in the night sky, but Arthur pays more attention to the way the colours illuminate Merlin’ s face and how they reflect in his wide, awestruck eyes. Merlin’ s face is lit up in delight by the time the colours fade. He turns to Arthur with a blinding smile, and Arthur swallows. Because he can’t risk taking this away from him, not now, not for such selfish reasons as his own. “What were you going to say?” Merlin asks, and Arthur shakes his head. There’ll be another time, a time when Merlin isn’t heart broken and his eyes don’t reflect the night sky, when Arthur can form the words instead of just wanting to stare at him in awe. “Nothing,” he says. “Just… glad you’re here.” Merlin beams at him and bumps their shoulders. He doesn’ t pull away afterwards. “Me too.” + I. It’s a cold, wet Saturday in late Novem ber. The air is cold and the trees are bare, and the day has been lovely , the air crisp and the sky blue — up until about an hour ago. Then lunchtime came around and so did the dark clouds hanging heavy over Arthur ’s head, and of course it would start pouring down the mome nt he stepped out from the safety of the under ground station. As he rushes through the streets in the rain he’s eternally grateful that he had the foresight to bring a raincoat and that Merlin decided on meeting for a coffee rather than the walk he first suggested. A bell jingles as he pushes the door to The Round Table open and steps inside, coat dripping water onto the floor despite the short trip from the station to the café. He pulls the hood down and unzips the coat as he glances around the small and cozy space. It’s of little surprise that Merlin is nowhere to be seen; he does have a penchant for being late. Arthur decides to order while he waits, and scans over the menus above the bar. They’re all changed from their autumn and Halloween specials to limited winter and Christmas drinks, and the shelves are lined with yule logs, Christmas puddings, and fruity mince pies amongst their usual pastries and cakes. The only thing that’s missing, really , is the Christmas decoration and All I Want For Christmas Is You playing from the speakers, but Arthur figures it’s probably only a matter of days. He doesn ’t dislike Christmas per se, but he doesn’ t usually try to get himself into the Christmas spirit until December 1st, so he’s happy to see they still offer their autumn assortment. He orders a vegan caramel and hazelnut latte and a black coffee with a splash of dairy-free milk and a pinch of cinnam on. Just as he’s about to pay he throws in one of the gingerbread muffins too because he can’t help himself. It’s only a week until December , anyway . He’s just sat down with the drinks and the pastry when the bell above the door jingles again, a mop of wet, dark hair and dark blue eyes looking around until they spot him. Merlin grins widely and makes his way through the café. The corner of Arthur ’s mouth tugs up just the slightest. “Sorry I’m late!” Merlin says when he reaches him, and he does at least have the decency to look like he means it. “I forgot my umbrella at home and was hoping I could wait out the rain at the station,” he says as he shrugs off his wet coat and hangs it over the chair in front of Arthur . His hair is dripping water onto his dark green sweater and his cheeks are flushed a bright red from the cold. Arthur rolls his eyes good heartedly . “Only you, Merlin.” “That’ s not true!” Merlin exclaims, ruffling his hair and successfully splattering water droplets everywhere. “The forecast didn’ t say anything about a downpour!” “It did say it was going to rain,” Arthur points out. Merlin rolls his eyes as he steps aroun d the table. “It didn’ t say it was going to rain this much . Clotpole,” he says, and then he bends down and pulls Arthur into a tight, warm — if a little wet — hug. “I missed you.” Arthur wraps his arms around Merlin’ s back and hugs him back just as tightly . It’s only been a few months, and it’s not like they haven’ t talked, but between internships and work and Merlin being away as part of his graduate position, they’ve barely had any time to meet since graduation. And Arthur has missed him something fiercely . “We talked yesterday ,” he says, just to be an arse, and Merlin huffs out a laugh and hugs him just a little tighter . Arthur grins. “I missed you too.” Merlin squeezes him one more time and then he pulls back, plopping into his chair and pulling his waiting cup of coffee towards him. He takes a sip and hums satisfied, his lips pulling into a grin. The corners of it are soft and warm. “So, what ’s happened in your life? I want to know everything,” he says, leaning his elbows against the table. Arthur huffs out a laugh and takes a sip from his own warm drink. “You already know everything,” he says. “Nothing new has happened in the last eighteen hours, surprisingly enough.” Merlin just continues to grin at him. “How was the Halloween party?” “Good,” Arthur says. “Gwaine and Percy fell into the pool and Leon had to pull them out. They were both grounded and forced to spend the rest of the night sobering up in Gwaine’ s bathroom,” he tells him with a chuck le. “And Gwen looked so gorgeous in her costume we all thought Lance was going to get down and propose any second.” He grins. “Although I think he’ s probably got something a little more special planned.” Merlin chuckles. “Maybe not the most romantic situation when people are dressed up in outfits ranging from nothing to absolute absurdity and everyone is well beyond drunk. Good choice, Lance.” “I’m pretty sure Gwen would say yes if he proposed in a dumpster , to be fair .” Merlin laughs, warm and happy . “Yeah, she would.” “My costume wasn’ t nearly as good without my sorcerer , though,” Arthur says, and Merlin smiles widely . “I’m sure the mighty King Arthur is just as striking without him,” he says. Arthur shrugs. “Maybe,” he says, hiding his smile behind his cup. “But he definitely felt like something was missing.” Merlin’ s bright eyes crinkle at the corners. “I guess his sorcerer will have to make sure to show up next time, then,” he says. “I’m holding you to that,” Arthur says, giving him a pointed look. “So, how was Manchester? Seemed like you had a lot of fun.” Merlin’ s entire face lights up. “I did! It was so interesting to finally see everything I’ve learnt actually be used in practice, you know?” he says, and then he goes on a ramble about everything he saw in the three months he was away , everyone he met, all the things he got to do. Arthur has already heard more than half of this, but he has only heard it over the phone and through video calls with poor connection, and he’ll never mind hearing Merlin speak, no matter how many times he has to hear the same thing. A little distance and four months apart and the feelings in Arthur ’s chest haven’ t diminished in the slightest. At this point he figures they probably never will. “-and Sefa has promised to come here just before Christmas; we were thinking of heading up to Edinbur gh for the Christmas market. I’m just really excited to see her again, even if we saw each other a few weeks ago,” Merlin says with a laugh. He speaks about her a lot, Sefa, and it’ s clear he likes her . Arthur just isn’ t sure in which way . So he raises his eyebrow suggestively , and Merlin’ s quick to wave him of f. “No, it’s nothing like that,” he says with a chuckle. “We’re friends, and I’m pretty sure she and Daegal have something going on,” he adds and grins. Arthur nods in understanding, but frowns when Merlin gives him a funny look. “How about you?” Merlin asks, averting his eyes and grabbing one of the forks on the table. He pokes at the gingerbread muffin. “Mithian seems nice,” he says, and there’ s a strange tilt to his voice. And sure, Mithian is nice. Quite lovely , actually , and Arthur could see something happening between them, if he wasn’ t so damn gone on the person sitting in front of him. And so, this time, Arthur doesn’ t hesitate, doesn’ t stop himself or let himself back down. This time, he lets the words he’s wanted to say for so long roll off his tongue with an ease that really isn’ t all that surprising. “She is,” Merlin’ s lips tug up into something that is probably supposed to be a smile but looks more like a grimace, “but I’m far too busy pining over my best friend for the nth year in a row to really consider it.” It feels not so scary and very relievin g, to finally share the secret he never wanted to keep to begin with. Merlin snaps his head up to stare at him with wide eyes and Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “Oh come on, you can’ t be that oblivious.” Merlin huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “No. I just wasn’ t expecting you to actually admit it,” he says, and Arthur frowns at him. “I’ve been waiting for you to say something since we were fifteen.” Arthur balks. “Why did you wait for me to say something? If you knew , why didn’ t you say so?” Merlin shrugs, shoving a piece of muffin into his mouth. “I didn’ t want to force you to share something you weren’ t ready for, or feel like you were obligated to do anything about it. I know your dad isn’ t…” he grimaces, “the most approving.” Arthur snorts. “No shit. But seriously , since year ten?” he asks, and Merlin nods. Arthur huffs out a laugh, and leans back in his chair . “Guess all my anxiety about telling you was pretty unnecessary .” Merlin gives him a soft smile. “Y ou never needed to be anxious.” “I know ,” Arthur says with a sigh. “I’ve wanted you to know since I figured it out, but it always came up at bad times or something came in the way and ruined the moment,” he says. Merlin laughs. “But at a café on a random, miserable Saturday afternoon fit the bill?” he asks, mirth in his eyes. Arthur pushes down his own grin and shrugs. “Figured it was as good a day as any .” “Say it again,” Merlin says, leaning forward in his chair , his lips stretching wide as he smiles. Arthur rolls his eyes at him, but he feels his smile tug at his own cheeks. “I love you.” “I know that,” Merlin says with laughter in his voice. “Say the other thing,” he tells him. Arthur huf fs out a breath of a laugh and moves forwards so he’ s also leaning over the table. “I’m in love with you,” he says, holding Merlin’ s gaze. He doesn’ t bother fighting the smile anymore. “Have been since I was eleven.” Merlin grins, wide and bright and warm, and then he ducks forward and his lips catch Arthur ’s in a kiss that tastes like cinnamon and coffee and caramel. It is new and exciting just the same as it feels entirely natural, like something Arthur has done a hundred times before, something he’ll do hundreds and hundreds of times again. “Good,” Merlin says when he pulls away . “Because I’m in love with you too and I’d really like to add ‘boyfriend’ to the list of things I refer to you as in my head.” Arthur runs a thumb over Merlin’ s cheekbone and raises an eyebrow . He probably shouldn’ t ask, but he can’ t help himself. “Oh? And what other names do you have on that list?” “Clotpoll. Prat. Best friend. Ass. Arthur . Cabbagehead. Love of my life. Dollophead.” He laughs and kisses Merlin again. “Wouldn’ t be a complete list without boyfriend on there, would it?” Merlin grins at him again, bright and warm enough to rival the sun. “No, no it wouldn’ t.” End Notes Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!

But I’ve written and posted an autumn inspired fic every year since 2017 and I wasn’ t about to stop now . You couldn’ t best me, fic. (I’m actually pretty happy with how it turned out, all struggles considered!) For those of you who aren’ t familiar with the English school system, students are 1 1/12 years old in year 7 and 16/17 in sixth form! Also big thanks to the best Joji-san for sensitivity beta-ing Merlin for me!&lt;3 See the end of the work for more notes I. It’s early September and the days are not quite as warm as they’ve been. Arthur usually resents the coming of the cold, but this year he can’t help but grin when he pulls on his jacket over his school uniform. It’s not that he particularly likes the cold, but frigid and foggy mornings mean that the autumn term is finally starting and Arthur has looked forward to it since last semester ended. He loves the summer holidays and usually hates for them to end, but this year he hasn’ t been able to stop himself from wishing they would just be over already; he likes school well enough — he really likes learning about histor y and the sciences — but that’s not why he’s been almost bursting with excitement about going back. What’ s really been keeping him restless and eager the past few weeks has been the knowledge that with the start of the school term, comes meeting Merlin again. Arthur hasn’ t seen his best friend since the start of the summer, since Merlin has been away visiting family, and the summer has been dreadfully boring without him. Arthur is so excited to see him again he’s certain he’s been getting on his fathe r and sister ’s nerves with it — not that it stopped him from bouncing around the house this morning in his haste to get ready . And now, finally, he’s on his way to the first day of school for year seven. He’d be running if Morgana wasn’ t walking — like a snail because she’ s evil — with him. Arthur jumps up and down in his place on a pile of green leaves as he waits for her to catch up — she might as well crawl with how slowly she’ s walking. “Stop grinning like that, ” she says with a roll of her eyes. “One would think you have a crush on him, ” she adds and smirks. Arthur stops and scrunches his nose up. “I don’ t have a crush. Crushes are gross.” Morgana grins at him. “Sure, whatever . Just let me know if you need any help asking him to be your boyfriend, ” she says as she walks past him. “I don’t want him to be my boyfrien d, ” Arthur says with a frown as he falls into step with her. “I want him to be my friend.” “He can be both, you dummy, ” Mor gana tells him. “That’ s why it’ s called boy friend .” That makes Arthur pause in his steps, before he shakes his head and runs up to walk beside her again. “It’s a girl thing to have crushes, ” he says. He knows Elena talked about having crushes on some of the boys in year seven when they were still in year six, but he’s never heard any of his boy friends say anything about crushes. “And I’m not a girl.” Morgana snorts. “Then why did Father marry your mother?” she retorts. Arthur frowns in thought. He supposes that’s true, but he’s never had a crush before! Why would he have one on Merlin ? Aren’ t boys supposed to have crushes on girls, anyway? “But Merlin’ s not a girl either, ” he says, and Morgana pats him patronising ly on the shoulder because she thinks she knows so much more than he does just because she’ s two years older . “Doesn’ t mean you can’t like him, ” she says, and then she shoves him in old evil-sister - fashion, because apparently Arthur got so lost in his thoughts that he didn’ t notice they’d already reached the school. “See you later, brother!” she says, and then skips up the steps to meet her friends and leaves Arthur with a bunch of unanswered questions. Arthur frowns at her . Stupid Mor gana and her stupid friends. “Arthur!” He turns around at the sound of his name, grins widely when he spots Merlin — who is wrapped up in an oversized jacket and wears a neckerchief around his neck, even if it’ s barely below fifteen degrees outside, because he gets cold even when it’s not really all that chilly — and for gets all about crushes and Mor gana. He forgets it for a few hours, until lunch, when Merlin laughs loudly at Gwaine’ s stupid joke and Arthur ’s stomach flutters as if there are falling leaves or butterflies inside it. His eyes widen and he stops with his fork midway to his mouth. Maybe Morgana was right. Maybe he does want Merlin to be his boyfriend. For the rest of the day, Arthur can’t stop thinking about it, about how Merlin is kind of cute with his rosy cheeks and oversized jacket and clumsy boots, about how maybe Arthur wouldn’ t be so opposed to holding his hand, about how he would quite like to introduce Merlin as his ‘best friend and boyfriend’. Which means it’s become a thing that Arthur actually thinks might be true, which means that he has to tell Merlin about it, because they tell each other everything and Arthur isn’t about to start keeping secrets now. Only, he isn’t sure how to tell him. He’s not going to ask Morgana for help because she’s a witch who wants nothing but for Arthur to suffer, but who better to ask than his father, who is wise and smart and knows how everything works? So instead of going back to his room after dinner like he usually does, he follows his father to his office and stops outside it, rocking back and forth on his heels. His father’s office is dark mahogany and warm leather, and Arthur has always felt both intimidated and awed by it. “What is it, Arthur?” his father asks from his old leather chair, the evening paper in his hands. “Did everything go well at school today?” Arthur stops rocking on his feet and nods. “Y es, Father, it was fine, ” he says. “I was, uhm..” “Hesitation is not a desirable or respectable trait, Arthur . You should know better, ” his father says, not looking up from the paper . Arthur swallows, and then squares his shoulders. “You know Merlin, ” he says, and his father arches an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “W ell, I, uh- think I like him.” He means to go on, but his father looks up at him with a disapproving frow n that has Arthur snapping his mouth shut. “That’ s nonsense. Where did you get that idea?” he asks, and Arthur ’s shoulders hitch up just the slightest at the same time his stomach drops. “Uh- well, Mor gana said-“ His father scoffs. “Don’ t listen to your sister, she’s just trying to rile you up. You don’t like Merlin. Get that ridiculous notion out of your head. He’s a boy and so are you, ” he states, returning his focus to the paper . “Now, was there anything else?” “Erm, no, uh, thank you, ” Arthur says in a small voice. There’ s a lump in his throat and an uncomfortable feeling in his chest. His father dismisses him with a wave of his hand and Arthur quickly hurries to his room to bury himself under his duvet. Rain patters against his window . He suddenly feels very certain that he does have a crush on Merlin, and that he absolutely cannot tell him. II. The night air is chilly and wet, the late September rain filling the potholes in the road and leaving puddles on the pavement. The street lights flicker and the headlights of a passing car reflect in the pools of water, before the car drives through them and ruins it. There’ s a gale coming, the winds pulling at their clothes and nipping at their cheeks, the gloomy clouds rolling above their heads. Arthur blinks the wetness from his eyes and wipes the raindrop from his cheek and thinks that even the weather is miserable. He huddles into his worn hoodie in an attempt to stay warm, but even the heat from Merlin’ s leg pressed against his isn’t helping to stave off the early autumn chill. Arthur feels cold to the bone, and not just because of the wind that pushes cold air into the collar of his hoodie. They’ve started sixth form and it’s supposed to be exciting and fun and new, but all Arthur feels is lousy . “I don’t want you to leave, ” he mutters into his collar . It’s quiet and petulant and just the slightest bit angry, and Arthur doesn’ t care. He is angry, angry at Merlin for just up and leaving him like this with next to no warning. Only a few weeks ago things were great and Arthur was excited to start this new part of his life, and then Merlin went and told him he’s moving and everything turned horrible. Merlin sighs next to him, wrapped up in his thick jacket and the wool scarf Arthur knows his mother knitted him for Christmas two years ago; Arthur has a matching one, red to Merlin’ s blue. His cheeks are rosy red from the cold and his eyes are sad, their blue almost black in the dark of the night. “Me neither, ” he mumbles, burying his chin further into his scarf. “But with Mum’ s health we need to be closer to family and we can’t exactly ask them all to come to London, now can we?” he says with a laugh, but it sounds hollow in the dim street. Arthur doesn’t answer, because there really isn’t anything he can say, is there? It’s not like Merlin has a choice and Arthur can’t exactly demand that he leave his mother while she’s sick, no matter how much he wants him to stay . Merlin sighs again, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. “I’m going to miss it here, ” he says. A smile pulls at his lips as he watches the wet street and the dark park on the other side of it. “Remember when we were ten and we climbed the big tree and I broke my arm?” he asks, the corners of his eyes scrunching up just the slightest. As if Arthur could forget; he’d gotten a right heart attack, seeing Merlin cry and clutch his arm to his chest in pain. “The scolding from Mum was almost worse than the pain, ” Merlin contin ues with a laugh, and this one, at least, is real, if a little wet. He sniffles, grinning widely, and turns to Arthur . “But you were there the whole time — you wouldn’ t even leave the hospital. Told me stories about knights and sorcerers and drago ns to keep me distracted, and then you demanded that you got to write on my cast and you wrote your name so large no one else could fit theirs, like the self-entitled prat you are.” His smile softens into something a little sadder, and Arthur hates this so much. Hates saying goodbye. Doesn’ t even know if he knows how to. Merlin glances back at the clouds and the stars just starting to peek through them. “I’m going to miss you, ” he says, quietly, and Arthur thinks about telling him, then. About the feelings he’s been pushing away since he was eleven and his father told him he wasn’ t allowed to have them. About the flutters and the want and the maybe-I’m-in-love-with-you. Because this is Merlin and if he can’t tell Merlin then who could he ever hope to tell? If he can’t share this secret with Merlin — this secret that’s overwhelming and large and scary — then he doesn’ t think he can share it with anyone, and he’s not sure he can live with that. And he doesn’ t know when — if — he’ll see Merlin again, so if not now, when? But the words are too heavy in his chest and too big to travel through his throat and Arthur is too afraid and swallows them back down. “I say good riddan ce, ” he says instea d, knocking their shoulders together, because it’s easier than being vulnerable and he knows Merlin will get what he means anyway . Merlin grins at him, wet and sad and Arthur hates that he’s leaving. Hates that this is goodbye, even if neither of them actually says the word. “Prat.” III. Arthur and Merlin lose touch sometim e during the spring after Merlin leaves — because it’s difficult to keep in touch even when you really want to when you’re seventeen and everything around you is changing — and Arthur doesn’ t really expect for that to change. He certainly doesn’ t expect to find Merlin back in his life just a month into his first year at university, but here he is, sitting in the university library on a dark, wet Thursday evening in early October, when the leaves have just started to change colours into their bright yellows and vibra nt oranges and deep reds. And Merlin, dressed in a cozy, washe d out red sweater and taller and older than the Merlin that left, sits in front of him, typing away at his laptop. The librar y floor is silent besides the clacking of Merlin’ s keyboard and the occasional flip of a page from across the room where another group of students are sitting, their whispers quiet in the vast open space. It’s way too late to be studying, the world outside the windows dark save for the few streetlights strewn across campus. The rain patters agains t the glass and the occasional leaf falls past, illuminated by the lights from inside and the lamps outside. Arthur didn’t even know Merlin went to the same university as him until Gwen dragged Merlin along to their friend group’ s biweekly Sunday pub-quiz a few weeks ago and Merlin was promptly adopted into the group. Arthur didn’ t need the introduction Gwen gave, could have recognised Merlin anywhere, even when he was taller and older and just that much more pretty . And Merlin didn’ t seem to have any problem recognising him either, judging by the massive and heart-stopping grin he sent Arthur ’s way the moment their eyes met. Arthur thought he was over Merlin, he really did — not as a friend, because no number of years could ever remove how important Merlin has always been, but those nerve-wracking romantic feelings — and yet they’re there, right underneath his breastbone, humming and warm and as solid and real as they’d been the day he left Merlin on the steps to his building four years ago. And in the same way those feelings easily made their way back into Arthur ’s life, so did Merlin, and he’s made himself snug and comfortable as a constant presence that Arthur isn’t sure how he lived without for so long. Lance stretches beside Arthur, his bones cracking satisfyingly, and it reminds Arthur of just how long they’ve been sat here. “I think it’s time for me to head home, ” he says, closing his laptop and tucking it into his bag. “I’m pretty sure I’ll do better on the midterms if I actually get some sleep in between study sessions.” Arthur huffs out a laugh and leans back in his chair . He still has an assignment that needs to be submitted by midnight, but he really would love to go back to his own crappy dorm bed. “Sleep is for the weak, ” Merlin says, never taking his eyes of f his screen. Arthur and Lance share a look. Arthur shakes his head with a sigh. “I’ll follow you to the cafeteria, ” he says and stands up. “I’m going to need cof fee if I want to survive another two hours of this.” “Oh, get me one, will you?” Merlin asks. He’ s still not looking up from his laptop. Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “I’d tell you to get one yourself but I don’t think even a natural disaster could get you to move, ” he says. That, at least, gets Merlin to finally look up to grin at him. Lance chuckles, standing up and slinging his bag over his shoulder . “See you tomorrow, Merlin.” “See you tomorrow, Lance. Enjoy your sleep, ” Merlin says and turns to grin at him. “I will, ” Lance says. “Enjoy your studying.” “I won’ t.” “I’ll make sure he doesn’ t die, ” Arthur says, clasping Lance on the shoulder as he walks past him towards the stairs. He doesn’ t miss Merlin poking his tongue out at him, but Arthur is clearly the more mature person here because he stops himself from poking his tongue out right back at him. Lance laughs as he follows him, the sound loud in the quiet space. “And who’ s going to make sure you don’ t?” Arthur grins. “Merlin, of course.” Lance chuckles. “It’ll be a pleasant surprise if I see either of you alive and awake in the morning, then, ” he says and squeezes Arthur ’s shoulder . “Try to get some sleep at least.” “We will, ” Arthur says as they stop by the small cof fee hub. “T ell Gwen I said hi.” “Will do. Goodnight, Arthur, ” Lance says with a smile. “Night, ” Arthur says, waving him off as he leaves the library, and then steps up to the tired- looking student manning the cof fee. It’s only when he orders that he realises he doesn’ t know how Merlin likes his coffee. 16- year-old Merlin didn’ t drink coffee, and Arthur has only known 20-year -old Merlin for a few weeks. So he gets a vegan pumpkin spice latte for himself because he’s a basic bitch and it tastes good, and orders a large black coffee with just a bit of dairy-free-milk for Merlin and hopes it’ll do. That’ s how the Merlin he knew liked his tea. “One large dose of caffeine, ” he says as he places the takeaway mug next to Merlin’ s scattered notes. “Oh my god, thank you, ” Merlin says, moving the mug to his lips and taking a large gulp without so much as a wince. How he can drink it when it’s still scalding hot Arthur doesn’ t know, but he used to do that with hot chocolate and tea before too. “Oh, this is perfect. Thank you, Arthur, ” he says, grinning at Arthur with a brightness that rivals the bloody sun. Arthur hasn’ t seen Merlin in four years, and somehow it’s like no time has passed at all. He knows he doesn’ t really know this Merlin, this older version of him that has lived a life without Arthur, but he finds that he desperately wants to. Wants to know him in any way Merlin will let him, actually, and for a moment he wonders if this is the moment he should tell him. If it’s time to spill the secrets that are no longer held tightly against his chest but are still held close and only shared with a very select few. Maybe now, almost entirely alone on the third floor of the university library on a wet, dark evening in October, when they’re starting over and continuing on, is when he should let Merlin know how he feels. “Gosh I’m so happy to have you back in my life. I really missed you, ” Merlin says, grin soft around the edges, hair tousled just so and looking warm and cozy and like everything Arthur thinks he could ever want. Arthur ’s lips twitch into a smile hidden behind his mug, the steam curling warm around his nose. “No one managed to take my place, then?” he says, and Merlin laughs. “No, you prat. No one’s ego is large enough, ” he says. “But no, I’ve only ever had one best friend, ” he adds, smile wide and happy and warm, and Arthur doesn’ t want to risk ruining that, or the second chance they’ve been given. So he smiles back and tucks the feelings into the pocket he kept them in for so long before, and says, “Me too.” IV. “Merlin, do you really think this is a good idea? You don’t think it’s a little too.. on the nose?” Arthur asks as he twists and turns in front of the body-length mirror in Merlin’ s flat. It’s not that he doesn’t think he looks good — the costume is very high quality and Arthur is going to have to wear it for every single costume party for the rest of his life with how much it cost — but it feels a little too ridiculous. They’ve been teased about this since they became friends in primary; is it really necessary to add fuel to the flame? “That’ s why it’ s so good!” Merlin calls from the bathroom. Arthur sighs. The things he does for him. “Are you nearly finished or are we going to be three hours late again?” “Yeah yeah, done in a second! This bloody beard doesn’ t want to stick, ” Merlin says. “Need any help?” Arthur asks as he tightens the belt around his waist and pulls on his red cape. He grabs the small pink, purpl e, and blue dragon pin from Merlin’ s desk and fiddles with it. It’s his favourite pride pin, given to him by Merlin after he finally gathered up the courage to tell him that he likes people romantically and no one sexua lly, regardless of gender . It still scares him to wear it, despite the pride he feels. He wonders how long it’ll take before it stops making his stomach swoop anxiously, if it ever will stop. “No, all good!” Merlin says, and then he’s bouncing out from the bathroom and Arthur can’t help the loud laugh that escapes him. “You look absolutely ridiculous, ” he says. “Remind me to never let you grow a beard.” Merlin pouts at him, and it makes him look even more bizarre in his red robes and long white fake beard and scraggly wig. He’ s even added wrinkles. “Who said Merlin the Wizard had to be old?” Arthur asks, still fiddling with the pin in his hands. “Maybe he was a fit young sorcerer .” Merlin rolls his eyes and steps forward, hands reaching to grab the pin from Arthur ’s hands. He hums as he removes the pin lock. “King Arthur ’s young lover, perhaps?” he says, glancing up briefly at Arthur before he returns his attention to fastening the pin to Arthur ’s cape. Arthur swallows. “W ell, history always did have a way of being pretty gay .” Merlin snorts. “You can say that again.” He finishes fastening the pin, runs his hands over the fabric of the cape, and then steps back. He grins at Arthur . “Now we match, ” he says, tugging at his red robes and the bi-coloured butterfly and the non-binary he/him pins fastened on the left side of his chest. Arthur huf fs out a laugh, heart thudding in his chest. “You look great, ” Merlin adds, giving him a once-over . “The Great King of Camelot.” “Thanks, ” Arthur says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. “Y ou look old.” Merlin rolls his eyes at him again, and really it fits his costume perfectly . “Prat.” “That’ s Your Royal Prat to you, Sorce rer, ” Arthur says as he makes sure he has all his things and picks up Merli n’s phone before grabbing hold of Merlin’ s arm. “Now come on, the court awaits us.” Gwaine has really gone all out. His house is decked out with skeletons and ghosts and spider - web, a row of pumpkins that Arthur recognises from their annual pumpkin-carving competition litters his front porch, and the music blasting from the living room is nothing if not the Ghostbusters soundtrack. Gwaine himself is dressed in a leather costume that shows more skin than perhaps is socially acceptable but is entirely expected from him and a winged eyeliner that even Arthur is jealous of even if he very rarely wears makeup. No way the Playboy bunnies are getting all the fun, as Gwai ne said a few years ago when he wore a literal Playboy bunny outfit for Halloween. He’ s only outdone himself since. “Friends! You made it, ” he calls when they walk through the door. “I’m loving the couple’ s costume, ” he says with a wide grin. Arthur rolls his eyes at him and lets himself be pulled into a mostly naked hug. “Thanks. It was all Merlin’ s idea, ” he says when Gwaine pulls Merlin into a similar hug. Gwaine grins at Merlin, slapping him on the shoulder . “Of course it was.” Merlin grins back at him proudly . His fake beard is already starting to peel, so Arthur pushes it back in place. “You want anything to drink?” Gwaine asks, motioning towards the kitchen that is only a little less crowded than the living room and the hall. Arthur shrugs. “Why not.” “I’m alright, thanks. I’m going to find Gwen! I promised her I’d show her my outfit as soon as I came, ” Merlin says, waving them off and disappearing into the throng of people and further into the house. “Alright then, what can I offer you, Princess?” Gwaine asks as he leads Arthur into the kitchen. There are orange streamers hanging from the ceiling and the kitchen table is littered with an array of drinks and bottles. Arthur rolls his eyes again. “Honestly, anything’ s fine so long as it’s not deadly . I do have to attend lunch with my father and sister tomorrow, and as much as I think Morgana would love to see me hungover I don’t think Father would be too impressed, ” he says, scowling when Gwaine grins at him. “Your daddy’s always been a stick in the mud, ” he says, and Arthur scrunc hes his nose up at the choice of word, but can’t disagr ee with the rest. “I’m going to make you a potion of courage so you can finally get around to telling Merlin how you feel. You’ll only feel it a little in the morning, I promise, ” he says with a smile that tells Arthur he’s definitely going to feel it more than a little. Arthur purses his lips and gives him an unimpressed glare, but doesn’ t stop him when Gwaine grabs a few of the bottles strewn across the table and starts pouring liquids of different colours into a glass. “Oh, come on, mate. You’ve been pining for him since primary school. Don’ t you think it’s about time?” Honestly Arthur doesn’ t know why he ever told Gwaine about his feelings for Merlin, but then he probably wasn’ t very sober when he did and it was definitely Gwaine and his scarily- tasty, very-alcoholic drinks’ fault. He raises an eyebrow when Gwaine drops a small, round item into his drink and holds it out to him. “And I’m perfectly fine pining until I die, ” he says, taking the glass and watching the fake eye bob up and down in the colourful drink. He gives Gwaine a skeptical look before taking a sip. “Oh my god, ” he says, making a face. It’ s way too strong and tastes way too good. “What the hell did you put in this?” Gwaine just grins at him and slaps him on the shoulder . “Just think about it, ” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen. Arthur doesn’ t tell him that he has thought about it, multiple times. He takes another sip from the drink and grimaces again. God he’s not having any more to drink after this one. Arthur has thought about it, more times than he can count, really, has been close to telling Merlin a handful of times too. And yet, Gwaine’ s words make him think about it again, because honestly he isn’t sure he really is fine pining until the day he dies. He loves being friends with Merlin more than anything and if that’ s what they’re always going to be then that is more than fine with him, but he’s not sure he could go his entire life not knowing if that’s what Merlin wants or if their relationship could be something else. It’s probably the ridiculous amount of alcohol in the drink Gwaine made, but he’s feeling a little daring tonight. He won’ t ever know what Merlin feels if he never asks, right? So he spends almost half an hour walking through Gwaine’ s house trying to find Merlin somewhere in the crowd of witches and superheroes and pirates and ghosts, with little success. But he’ s made up his mind now, and like hell he’ s going to chicken out. It’s only when he goes outside into the cold night air that he spots him in the corner of the garden, face softly illuminated by the string of yellow lights hanging in the red and orange trees. He’s sitting, rather close, too, and laughing with a girl — Freya, Arthur thinks, from one of Merlin’ s nerdy societies. They’re turned towards each other, knees touching and smiles on their faces, caught in conve rsation. They look like they’ve forgotten the rest of the world exists, as if there’ s only the two of them, and Arthur ’s stomach drops. He guesses he wasn’ t meant to tell Merlin today either . He’s just about to turn around and go back inside when Merlin spots him. Merlin turns and grins at him, and Arthur, in turn, just gives him an awkward wave. Merlin turns back to Freya, saying something that has her smiling widely and nodding, and then he ducks in to leave a lingering kiss on her cheek before standing up and making his way towards Arthur . He doesn’ t take his eyes off her until he’s reached him, and Arthur supposes there’ s no need to ask. It’ s plenty obvious what Merlin feels. So, instead, he forces a grin and wiggles his eyebrows when Merlin finally looks at him. Merlin just laughs, cheeks dusted red, and punches him in the arm. V. The tube is crowded, with people packed shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and groups of friends squeezed too many into a row of seats. Arthur is tucked — more like wedged, really — between Merlin and Percival, the rest of their friends crammed in around them. There’ s really no use in trying to follow any of the conversations happening around him with the loud noise of the train and the laughter and chatter filling the car from all directions, and it’s much too tight to get a hold of his phone, so Arthur settles with staring off into the space in front of him. Which happens to hold a glum looking Merlin. It’s not very cold on the tube — the body temperature of all eight hundre d or so people are doing wonders against the early November cold — but Merlin is wrapped up in his usual blue scarf, chin tucked into it, and huddled into a thick rust red jacket. The dark grey wool beanie he’s wear ing has a small cat with a red neckerchief on the brim, his dark hair curling around it. He’s clearly trying to follow whatev er conversation Morgana, Leon, Lance, and Gwen are having on the other side of Percival, but Arthur can barely hear them so he figures Merlin isn’t much better off. He knows why he’s trying though, knows why there’s a small frown pulling at his brow and why there’ s a tired set to his shoulders and bags under his eyes. Arthur wishes he could help, wishes he could cheer him up, get him out of his own head and forget about Freya for a moment, but he’s shit at these things. What do you tell someone who’ s just been broken up with by their year-long girlfriend? Merlin really liked Freya, probably even loved her; what do you say to someone who’ s gotten their heart broken? Arthur isn’t sure he’d want anyone to say anything reassuring to him at all, honestly . It’s all empty words, anyway . So he doesn’ t say anything reassuring. Instead, he says, “Your face is going to get stuck if you keep frowning like that, ” because he’ s an idiot. Merlin rolls his eyes at him, but the frown loosens up just the slightest, so Arthur takes it as a win. “You’re one to speak, with how you brood half the time. You’re going to get wrinkles, ” Merlin retorts. Arthur gapes at him, af fronted. “I don’ t brood!” Merlin snorts. He squeezes his hand up between them and runs his thumb over Arthur ’s forehead. “Then what’ s this, Mr. Sunshine?” he says, and Arthur immediately tries to relax the scowl he’d barely noticed. “I’m a delight, thank you very much.” Merlin huffs out a laugh, and it’s a little happier, at least. Instead of trying to pull his arm down to his side again, he simply lets it rest against Arthur ’s chest, hand steady on his shoulder . Arthur wonders if Merlin can feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. “You’re about as delightful as the flu, ” Merlin tells him. Arthur can’t help himself, and smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “What, getting you all hot and bothered?” he asks, and Merlin lets out a loud, startled laugh. Warmth fills Arthur ’s chest at the look Merlin gives him, his eyes twinkling with mirth. He hasn’ t seen Merlin smile so widely in weeks. He grins crookedly back at him. “You wish, ” Merlin says, and becaus e their proximity means he can’t punch Arthur in the arm like he usually would, he resorts to pinching his neck lightly . Arthur complains out loud, and wonders silently if he should admit that yes, he kind of does. “This station is W ood Gr een, ” the announcement sounds over the intercom, and as soon as the tube stops almost the entire car fills out into the station. And from there it’s a rush of bodies and excitement and street food and drinks, watching the large bonfire get lit and its fire grow, yelling more than speaking the rhyme, and cheering over the morbid tradition of watching a man made of straw be set on fire. It’s fun and pleasant and the drinks are warm where the night is cold, and they’re all bundled together as close to the fire as they can get. Arthur stands next to Merlin, a cup of hot apple cider in his hands, watchin g from the corner of his eye as Merlin stares absentmindedly into the fire. The light of the bonfire casts shadows and a yellow glow across his face that makes him look ethereal. The quiet content in his eyes has Arthu r’s heart aching in his chest, because Merlin deserves this always, to feel content and happy and cherished. Merlin deserves to know that someone loves him, now more than ever, when he feels broken and unloveable. It’s their final year, and while Arthur doesn’ t think he could let go of Merl in again so easily, they’re graduating soon and life takes turns you don’t expect it to. He might not get another chance, might not gather up the courage again before it’ s too late. “Merlin, ” he starts, and Merlin turns to him with a hum, eyes softly crinkled at the corners. His cheeks are a little rosy from the nipping wind, but he looks warm and comfortable and Arthur is so ridiculously in love. Arthur opens his mouth to continue — to tell him, finally — but that’s when the first firework goes off and the world is lit with a wonderful array of colours. Merlin turns his head with a surprised laugh to watch the display in the night sky, but Arthur pays more attention to the way the colours illuminate Merlin’ s face and how they reflect in his wide, awestruck eyes. Merlin’ s face is lit up in delight by the time the colours fade. He turns to Arthur with a blinding smile, and Arthur swallows. Because he can’t risk taking this away from him, not now, not for such selfish reasons as his own. “What were you going to say?” Merlin asks, and Arthur shakes his head. There’ll be another time, a time when Merlin isn’t heart broken and his eyes don’t reflect the night sky, when Arthur can form the words instead of just wanting to stare at him in awe. “Nothing, ” he says. “Just… glad you’re here.” Merlin beams at him and bumps their shoulders. He doesn’ t pull away afterwards. “Me too.” + I. It’s a cold, wet Saturday in late Novem ber. The air is cold and the trees are bare, and the day has been lovely, the air crisp and the sky blue — up until about an hour ago. Then lunchtime came around and so did the dark clouds hanging heavy over Arthur ’s head, and of course it would start pouring down the mome nt he stepped out from the safety of the under ground station. As he rushes through the streets in the rain he’s eternally grateful that he had the foresight to bring a raincoat and that Merlin decided on meeting for a coffee rather than the walk he first suggested. A bell jingles as he pushes the door to The Round Table open and steps inside, coat dripping water onto the floor despite the short trip from the station to the café. He pulls the hood down and unzips the coat as he glances around the small and cozy space. It’s of little surprise that Merlin is nowhere to be seen; he does have a penchant for being late. Arthur decides to order while he waits, and scans over the menus above the bar. They’re all changed from their autumn and Halloween specials to limited winter and Christmas drinks, and the shelves are lined with yule logs, Christmas puddings, and fruity mince pies amongst their usual pastries and cakes. The only thing that’s missing, really, is the Christmas decoration and All I Want For Christmas Is You playing from the speakers, but Arthur figures it’s probably only a matter of days. He doesn ’t dislike Christmas per se, but he doesn’ t usually try to get himself into the Christmas spirit until December 1st, so he’s happy to see they still offer their autumn assortment. He orders a vegan caramel and hazelnut latte and a black coffee with a splash of dairy-free milk and a pinch of cinnam on. Just as he’s about to pay he throws in one of the gingerbread muffins too because he can’t help himself. It’s only a week until December, anyway . He’s just sat down with the drinks and the pastry when the bell above the door jingles again, a mop of wet, dark hair and dark blue eyes looking around until they spot him. Merlin grins widely and makes his way through the café. The corner of Arthur ’s mouth tugs up just the slightest. “Sorry I’m late!” Merlin says when he reaches him, and he does at least have the decency to look like he means it. “I forgot my umbrella at home and was hoping I could wait out the rain at the station, ” he says as he shrugs off his wet coat and hangs it over the chair in front of Arthur . His hair is dripping water onto his dark green sweater and his cheeks are flushed a bright red from the cold. Arthur rolls his eyes good heartedly . “Only you, Merlin.” “That’ s not true!” Merlin exclaims, ruffling his hair and successfully splattering water droplets everywhere. “The forecast didn’ t say anything about a downpour!” “It did say it was going to rain, ” Arthur points out. Merlin rolls his eyes as he steps aroun d the table. “It didn’ t say it was going to rain this much . Clotpole, ” he says, and then he bends down and pulls Arthur into a tight, warm — if a little wet — hug. “I missed you.” Arthur wraps his arms around Merlin’ s back and hugs him back just as tightly . It’s only been a few months, and it’s not like they haven’ t talked, but between internships and work and Merlin being away as part of his graduate position, they’ve barely had any time to meet since graduation. And Arthur has missed him something fiercely . “We talked yesterday, ” he says, just to be an arse, and Merlin huffs out a laugh and hugs him just a little tighter . Arthur grins. “I missed you too.” Merlin squeezes him one more time and then he pulls back, plopping into his chair and pulling his waiting cup of coffee towards him. He takes a sip and hums satisfied, his lips pulling into a grin. The corners of it are soft and warm. “So, what ’s happened in your life? I want to know everything, ” he says, leaning his elbows against the table. Arthur huffs out a laugh and takes a sip from his own warm drink. “You already know everything, ” he says. “Nothing new has happened in the last eighteen hours, surprisingly enough.” Merlin just continues to grin at him. “How was the Halloween party?” “Good, ” Arthur says. “Gwaine and Percy fell into the pool and Leon had to pull them out. They were both grounded and forced to spend the rest of the night sobering up in Gwaine’ s bathroom, ” he tells him with a chuck le. “And Gwen looked so gorgeous in her costume we all thought Lance was going to get down and propose any second.” He grins. “Although I think he’ s probably got something a little more special planned.” Merlin chuckles. “Maybe not the most romantic situation when people are dressed up in outfits ranging from nothing to absolute absurdity and everyone is well beyond drunk. Good choice, Lance.” “I’m pretty sure Gwen would say yes if he proposed in a dumpster, to be fair .” Merlin laughs, warm and happy . “Yeah, she would.” “My costume wasn’ t nearly as good without my sorcerer, though, ” Arthur says, and Merlin smiles widely . “I’m sure the mighty King Arthur is just as striking without him, ” he says. Arthur shrugs. “Maybe, ” he says, hiding his smile behind his cup. “But he definitely felt like something was missing.” Merlin’ s bright eyes crinkle at the corners. “I guess his sorcerer will have to make sure to show up next time, then, ” he says. “I’m holding you to that, ” Arthur says, giving him a pointed look. “So, how was Manchester? Seemed like you had a lot of fun.” Merlin’ s entire face lights up. “I did! It was so interesting to finally see everything I’ve learnt actually be used in practice, you know?” he says, and then he goes on a ramble about everything he saw in the three months he was away, everyone he met, all the things he got to do. Arthur has already heard more than half of this, but he has only heard it over the phone and through video calls with poor connection, and he’ll never mind hearing Merlin speak, no matter how many times he has to hear the same thing. A little distance and four months apart and the feelings in Arthur ’s chest haven’ t diminished in the slightest. At this point he figures they probably never will. “-and Sefa has promised to come here just before Christmas; we were thinking of heading up to Edinbur gh for the Christmas market. I’m just really excited to see her again, even if we saw each other a few weeks ago, ” Merlin says with a laugh. He speaks about her a lot, Sefa, and it’ s clear he likes her . Arthur just isn’ t sure in which way . So he raises his eyebrow suggestively, and Merlin’ s quick to wave him of f. “No, it’s nothing like that, ” he says with a chuckle. “We’re friends, and I’m pretty sure she and Daegal have something going on, ” he adds and grins. Arthur nods in understanding, but frowns when Merlin gives him a funny look. “How about you?” Merlin asks, averting his eyes and grabbing one of the forks on the table. He pokes at the gingerbread muffin. “Mithian seems nice, ” he says, and there’ s a strange tilt to his voice. And sure, Mithian is nice. Quite lovely, actually, and Arthur could see something happening between them, if he wasn’ t so damn gone on the person sitting in front of him. And so, this time, Arthur doesn’ t hesitate, doesn’ t stop himself or let himself back down. This time, he lets the words he’s wanted to say for so long roll off his tongue with an ease that really isn’ t all that surprising. “She is, ” Merlin’ s lips tug up into something that is probably supposed to be a smile but looks more like a grimace, “but I’m far too busy pining over my best friend for the nth year in a row to really consider it.” It feels not so scary and very relievin g, to finally share the secret he never wanted to keep to begin with. Merlin snaps his head up to stare at him with wide eyes and Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “Oh come on, you can’ t be that oblivious.” Merlin huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “No. I just wasn’ t expecting you to actually admit it, ” he says, and Arthur frowns at him. “I’ve been waiting for you to say something since we were fifteen.” Arthur balks. “Why did you wait for me to say something? If you knew, why didn’ t you say so?” Merlin shrugs, shoving a piece of muffin into his mouth. “I didn’ t want to force you to share something you weren’ t ready for, or feel like you were obligated to do anything about it. I know your dad isn’ t…” he grimaces, “the most approving.” Arthur snorts. “No shit. But seriously, since year ten?” he asks, and Merlin nods. Arthur huffs out a laugh, and leans back in his chair . “Guess all my anxiety about telling you was pretty unnecessary .” Merlin gives him a soft smile. “Y ou never needed to be anxious.” “I know, ” Arthur says with a sigh. “I’ve wanted you to know since I figured it out, but it always came up at bad times or something came in the way and ruined the moment, ” he says. Merlin laughs. “But at a café on a random, miserable Saturday afternoon fit the bill?” he asks, mirth in his eyes. Arthur pushes down his own grin and shrugs. “Figured it was as good a day as any .” “Say it again, ” Merlin says, leaning forward in his chair, his lips stretching wide as he smiles. Arthur rolls his eyes at him, but he feels his smile tug at his own cheeks. “I love you.” “I know that, ” Merlin says with laughter in his voice. “Say the other thing, ” he tells him. Arthur huf fs out a breath of a laugh and moves forwards so he’ s also leaning over the table. “I’m in love with you, ” he says, holding Merlin’ s gaze. He doesn’ t bother fighting the smile anymore. “Have been since I was eleven.” Merlin grins, wide and bright and warm, and then he ducks forward and his lips catch Arthur ’s in a kiss that tastes like cinnamon and coffee and caramel. It is new and exciting just the same as it feels entirely natural, like something Arthur has done a hundred times before, something he’ll do hundreds and hundreds of times again. “Good, ” Merlin says when he pulls away . “Because I’m in love with you too and I’d really like to add ‘boyfriend’ to the list of things I refer to you as in my head.” Arthur runs a thumb over Merlin’ s cheekbone and raises an eyebrow . He probably shouldn’ t ask, but he can’ t help himself. “Oh? And what other names do you have on that list?” “Clotpoll. Prat. Best friend. Ass. Arthur . Cabbagehead. Love of my life. Dollophead.” He laughs and kisses Merlin again. “Wouldn’ t be a complete list without boyfriend on there, would it?” Merlin grins at him again, bright and warm enough to rival the sun. “No, no it wouldn’ t.” End Notes Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!

    <div class="stat-item"><strong>Published:</strong> 2021-1 1-18 Words: 7,842 Chapters: 1/1 Six Falls and a Confession by a_written_dream Summary Arthur figures out that he&#x27;s in love with Merlin when he&#x27;s 1 1. It takes him more than a decade to finally tell him. Or: Five times Arthur wants to tell Merlin and one time he does. Notes This fic really fought me at every turn; first I couldn&#x27;t come up with an idea, and then I wasn&#x27;t in the mood, and then when I actually sat down and to write it would only come out by heavy force. But I’ve written and posted an autumn inspired fic every year since 2017 and I wasn’ t about to stop now . You couldn’ t best me, fic. (I’m actually pretty happy with how it turned out, all struggles considered!) For those of you who aren’ t familiar with the English school system, students are 1 1/12 years old in year 7 and 16/17 in sixth form! Also big thanks to the best Joji-san for sensitivity beta-ing Merlin for me!&lt;3 See the end of the work for more notes I. It’s early September and the days are not quite as warm as they’ve been. Arthur usually resents the coming of the cold, but this year he can’t help but grin when he pulls on his jacket over his school uniform. It’s not that he particularly likes the cold, but frigid and foggy mornings mean that the autumn term is finally starting and Arthur has looked forward to it since last semester ended. He loves the summer holidays and usually hates for them to end, but this year he hasn’ t been able to stop himself from wishing they would just be over already; he likes school well enough — he really likes learning about histor y and the sciences — but that’s not why he’s been almost bursting with excitement about going back. What’ s really been keeping him restless and eager the past few weeks has been the knowledge that with the start of the school term, comes meeting Merlin again. Arthur hasn’ t seen his best friend since the start of the summer , since Merlin has been away visiting family , and the summer has been dreadfully boring without him. Arthur is so excited to see him again he’s certain he’s been getting on his fathe r and sister ’s nerves with it — not that it stopped him from bouncing around the house this morning in his haste to get ready . And now, finally , he’s on his way to the first day of school for year seven. He’d be running if Morgana wasn’ t walking — like a snail because she’ s evil — with him. Arthur jumps up and down in his place on a pile of green leaves as he waits for her to catch up — she might as well crawl with how slowly she’ s walking. “Stop grinning like that,” she says with a roll of her eyes. “One would think you have a crush on him,” she adds and smirks. Arthur stops and scrunches his nose up. “I don’ t have a crush. Crushes are gross.” Morgana grins at him. “Sure, whatever . Just let me know if you need any help asking him to be your boyfriend,” she says as she walks past him. “I don’t want him to be my boyfrien d,” Arthur says with a frown as he falls into step with her. “I want him to be my friend.” “He can be both, you dummy ,” Mor gana tells him. “That’ s why it’ s called boy friend .” That makes Arthur pause in his steps, before he shakes his head and runs up to walk beside her again. “It’s a girl thing to have crushes,” he says. He knows Elena talked about having crushes on some of the boys in year seven when they were still in year six, but he’s never heard any of his boy friends say anything about crushes. “And I’m not a girl.” Morgana snorts. “Then why did Father marry your mother?” she retorts. Arthur frowns in thought. He supposes that’s true, but he’s never had a crush before! Why would he have one on Merlin ? Aren’ t boys supposed to have crushes on girls, anyway? “But Merlin’ s not a girl either ,” he says, and Morgana pats him patronising ly on the shoulder because she thinks she knows so much more than he does just because she’ s two years older . “Doesn’ t mean you can’t like him,” she says, and then she shoves him in old evil-sister - fashion, because apparently Arthur got so lost in his thoughts that he didn’ t notice they’d already reached the school. “See you later, brother!” she says, and then skips up the steps to meet her friends and leaves Arthur with a bunch of unanswered questions. Arthur frowns at her . Stupid Mor gana and her stupid friends. “Arthur!” He turns around at the sound of his name, grins widely when he spots Merlin — who is wrapped up in an oversized jacket and wears a neckerchief around his neck, even if it’ s barely below fifteen degrees outside, because he gets cold even when it’s not really all that chilly — and for gets all about crushes and Mor gana. He forgets it for a few hours, until lunch, when Merlin laughs loudly at Gwaine’ s stupid joke and Arthur ’s stomach flutters as if there are falling leaves or butterflies inside it. His eyes widen and he stops with his fork midway to his mouth. Maybe Morgana was right. Maybe he does want Merlin to be his boyfriend. For the rest of the day, Arthur can’t stop thinking about it, about how Merlin is kind of cute with his rosy cheeks and oversized jacket and clumsy boots, about how maybe Arthur wouldn’ t be so opposed to holding his hand, about how he would quite like to introduce Merlin as his ‘best friend and boyfriend’. Which means it’s become a thing that Arthur actually thinks might be true, which means that he has to tell Merlin about it, because they tell each other everything and Arthur isn’t about to start keeping secrets now. Only , he isn’t sure how to tell him. He’s not going to ask Morgana for help because she’s a witch who wants nothing but for Arthur to suffer, but who better to ask than his father , who is wise and smart and knows how everything works? So instead of going back to his room after dinner like he usually does, he follows his father to his office and stops outside it, rocking back and forth on his heels. His father’s office is dark mahogany and warm leather , and Arthur has always felt both intimidated and awed by it. “What is it, Arthur?” his father asks from his old leather chair , the evening paper in his hands. “Did everything go well at school today?” Arthur stops rocking on his feet and nods. “Y es, Father , it was fine,” he says. “I was, uhm..” “Hesitation is not a desirable or respectable trait, Arthur . You should know better ,” his father says, not looking up from the paper . Arthur swallows, and then squares his shoulders. “You know Merlin,” he says, and his father arches an eyebrow in acknowledgement. “W ell, I, uh- think I like him.” He means to go on, but his father looks up at him with a disapproving frow n that has Arthur snapping his mouth shut. “That’ s nonsense. Where did you get that idea?” he asks, and Arthur ’s shoulders hitch up just the slightest at the same time his stomach drops. “Uh- well, Mor gana said-“ His father scoffs. “Don’ t listen to your sister , she’s just trying to rile you up. You don’t like Merlin. Get that ridiculous notion out of your head. He’s a boy and so are you,” he states, returning his focus to the paper . “Now , was there anything else?” “Erm, no, uh, thank you,” Arthur says in a small voice. There’ s a lump in his throat and an uncomfortable feeling in his chest. His father dismisses him with a wave of his hand and Arthur quickly hurries to his room to bury himself under his duvet. Rain patters against his window . He suddenly feels very certain that he does have a crush on Merlin, and that he absolutely cannot tell him. II. The night air is chilly and wet, the late September rain filling the potholes in the road and leaving puddles on the pavement. The street lights flicker and the headlights of a passing car reflect in the pools of water , before the car drives through them and ruins it. There’ s a gale coming, the winds pulling at their clothes and nipping at their cheeks, the gloomy clouds rolling above their heads. Arthur blinks the wetness from his eyes and wipes the raindrop from his cheek and thinks that even the weather is miserable. He huddles into his worn hoodie in an attempt to stay warm, but even the heat from Merlin’ s leg pressed against his isn’t helping to stave off the early autumn chill. Arthur feels cold to the bone, and not just because of the wind that pushes cold air into the collar of his hoodie. They’ve started sixth form and it’s supposed to be exciting and fun and new, but all Arthur feels is lousy . “I don’t want you to leave,” he mutters into his collar . It’s quiet and petulant and just the slightest bit angry , and Arthur doesn’ t care. He is angry , angry at Merlin for just up and leaving him like this with next to no warning. Only a few weeks ago things were great and Arthur was excited to start this new part of his life, and then Merlin went and told him he’s moving and everything turned horrible. Merlin sighs next to him, wrapped up in his thick jacket and the wool scarf Arthur knows his mother knitted him for Christmas two years ago; Arthur has a matching one, red to Merlin’ s blue. His cheeks are rosy red from the cold and his eyes are sad, their blue almost black in the dark of the night. “Me neither ,” he mumbles, burying his chin further into his scarf. “But with Mum’ s health we need to be closer to family and we can’t exactly ask them all to come to London, now can we?” he says with a laugh, but it sounds hollow in the dim street. Arthur doesn’t answer, because there really isn’t anything he can say, is there? It’s not like Merlin has a choice and Arthur can’t exactly demand that he leave his mother while she’s sick, no matter how much he wants him to stay . Merlin sighs again, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. “I’m going to miss it here,” he says. A smile pulls at his lips as he watches the wet street and the dark park on the other side of it. “Remember when we were ten and we climbed the big tree and I broke my arm?” he asks, the corners of his eyes scrunching up just the slightest. As if Arthur could forget; he’d gotten a right heart attack, seeing Merlin cry and clutch his arm to his chest in pain. “The scolding from Mum was almost worse than the pain,” Merlin contin ues with a laugh, and this one, at least, is real, if a little wet. He sniffles, grinning widely , and turns to Arthur . “But you were there the whole time — you wouldn’ t even leave the hospital. Told me stories about knights and sorcerers and drago ns to keep me distracted, and then you demanded that you got to write on my cast and you wrote your name so large no one else could fit theirs, like the self-entitled prat you are.” His smile softens into something a little sadder , and Arthur hates this so much. Hates saying goodbye. Doesn’ t even know if he knows how to. Merlin glances back at the clouds and the stars just starting to peek through them. “I’m going to miss you,” he says, quietly , and Arthur thinks about telling him, then. About the feelings he’s been pushing away since he was eleven and his father told him he wasn’ t allowed to have them. About the flutters and the want and the maybe-I’m-in-love-with-you. Because this is Merlin and if he can’t tell Merlin then who could he ever hope to tell? If he can’t share this secret with Merlin — this secret that’s overwhelming and large and scary — then he doesn’ t think he can share it with anyone, and he’s not sure he can live with that. And he doesn’ t know when — if — he’ll see Merlin again, so if not now , when? But the words are too heavy in his chest and too big to travel through his throat and Arthur is too afraid and swallows them back down. “I say good riddan ce,” he says instea d, knocking their shoulders together , because it’s easier than being vulnerable and he knows Merlin will get what he means anyway . Merlin grins at him, wet and sad and Arthur hates that he’s leaving. Hates that this is goodbye, even if neither of them actually says the word. “Prat.” III. Arthur and Merlin lose touch sometim e during the spring after Merlin leaves — because it’s difficult to keep in touch even when you really want to when you’re seventeen and everything around you is changing — and Arthur doesn’ t really expect for that to change. He certainly doesn’ t expect to find Merlin back in his life just a month into his first year at university , but here he is, sitting in the university library on a dark, wet Thursday evening in early October , when the leaves have just started to change colours into their bright yellows and vibra nt oranges and deep reds. And Merlin, dressed in a cozy, washe d out red sweater and taller and older than the Merlin that left, sits in front of him, typing away at his laptop. The librar y floor is silent besides the clacking of Merlin’ s keyboard and the occasional flip of a page from across the room where another group of students are sitting, their whispers quiet in the vast open space. It’s way too late to be studying, the world outside the windows dark save for the few streetlights strewn across campus. The rain patters agains t the glass and the occasional leaf falls past, illuminated by the lights from inside and the lamps outside. Arthur didn’t even know Merlin went to the same university as him until Gwen dragged Merlin along to their friend group’ s biweekly Sunday pub-quiz a few weeks ago and Merlin was promptly adopted into the group. Arthur didn’ t need the introduction Gwen gave, could have recognised Merlin anywhere, even when he was taller and older and just that much more pretty . And Merlin didn’ t seem to have any problem recognising him either , judging by the massive and heart-stopping grin he sent Arthur ’s way the moment their eyes met. Arthur thought he was over Merlin, he really did — not as a friend, because no number of years could ever remove how important Merlin has always been, but those nerve-wracking romantic feelings — and yet they’re there, right underneath his breastbone, humming and warm and as solid and real as they’d been the day he left Merlin on the steps to his building four years ago. And in the same way those feelings easily made their way back into Arthur ’s life, so did Merlin, and he’s made himself snug and comfortable as a constant presence that Arthur isn’t sure how he lived without for so long. Lance stretches beside Arthur , his bones cracking satisfyingly , and it reminds Arthur of just how long they’ve been sat here. “I think it’s time for me to head home,” he says, closing his laptop and tucking it into his bag. “I’m pretty sure I’ll do better on the midterms if I actually get some sleep in between study sessions.” Arthur huffs out a laugh and leans back in his chair . He still has an assignment that needs to be submitted by midnight, but he really would love to go back to his own crappy dorm bed. “Sleep is for the weak,” Merlin says, never taking his eyes of f his screen. Arthur and Lance share a look. Arthur shakes his head with a sigh. “I’ll follow you to the cafeteria,” he says and stands up. “I’m going to need cof fee if I want to survive another two hours of this.” “Oh, get me one, will you?” Merlin asks. He’ s still not looking up from his laptop. Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “I’d tell you to get one yourself but I don’t think even a natural disaster could get you to move,” he says. That, at least, gets Merlin to finally look up to grin at him. Lance chuckles, standing up and slinging his bag over his shoulder . “See you tomorrow , Merlin.” “See you tomorrow , Lance. Enjoy your sleep,” Merlin says and turns to grin at him. “I will,” Lance says. “Enjoy your studying.” “I won’ t.” “I’ll make sure he doesn’ t die,” Arthur says, clasping Lance on the shoulder as he walks past him towards the stairs. He doesn’ t miss Merlin poking his tongue out at him, but Arthur is clearly the more mature person here because he stops himself from poking his tongue out right back at him. Lance laughs as he follows him, the sound loud in the quiet space. “And who’ s going to make sure you don’ t?” Arthur grins. “Merlin, of course.” Lance chuckles. “It’ll be a pleasant surprise if I see either of you alive and awake in the morning, then,” he says and squeezes Arthur ’s shoulder . “Try to get some sleep at least.” “We will,” Arthur says as they stop by the small cof fee hub. “T ell Gwen I said hi.” “Will do. Goodnight, Arthur ,” Lance says with a smile. “Night,” Arthur says, waving him off as he leaves the library , and then steps up to the tired- looking student manning the cof fee. It’s only when he orders that he realises he doesn’ t know how Merlin likes his coffee. 16- year-old Merlin didn’ t drink coffee, and Arthur has only known 20-year -old Merlin for a few weeks. So he gets a vegan pumpkin spice latte for himself because he’s a basic bitch and it tastes good, and orders a large black coffee with just a bit of dairy-free-milk for Merlin and hopes it’ll do. That’ s how the Merlin he knew liked his tea. “One large dose of caffeine,” he says as he places the takeaway mug next to Merlin’ s scattered notes. “Oh my god, thank you,” Merlin says, moving the mug to his lips and taking a large gulp without so much as a wince. How he can drink it when it’s still scalding hot Arthur doesn’ t know , but he used to do that with hot chocolate and tea before too. “Oh, this is perfect. Thank you, Arthur ,” he says, grinning at Arthur with a brightness that rivals the bloody sun. Arthur hasn’ t seen Merlin in four years, and somehow it’s like no time has passed at all. He knows he doesn’ t really know this Merlin, this older version of him that has lived a life without Arthur , but he finds that he desperately wants to. Wants to know him in any way Merlin will let him, actually , and for a moment he wonders if this is the moment he should tell him. If it’s time to spill the secrets that are no longer held tightly against his chest but are still held close and only shared with a very select few. Maybe now, almost entirely alone on the third floor of the university library on a wet, dark evening in October , when they’re starting over and continuing on, is when he should let Merlin know how he feels. “Gosh I’m so happy to have you back in my life. I really missed you,” Merlin says, grin soft around the edges, hair tousled just so and looking warm and cozy and like everything Arthur thinks he could ever want. Arthur ’s lips twitch into a smile hidden behind his mug, the steam curling warm around his nose. “No one managed to take my place, then?” he says, and Merlin laughs. “No, you prat. No one’s ego is large enough,” he says. “But no, I’ve only ever had one best friend,” he adds, smile wide and happy and warm, and Arthur doesn’ t want to risk ruining that, or the second chance they’ve been given. So he smiles back and tucks the feelings into the pocket he kept them in for so long before, and says, “Me too.” IV. “Merlin, do you really think this is a good idea? You don’t think it’s a little too.. on the nose?” Arthur asks as he twists and turns in front of the body-length mirror in Merlin’ s flat. It’s not that he doesn’t think he looks good — the costume is very high quality and Arthur is going to have to wear it for every single costume party for the rest of his life with how much it cost — but it feels a little too ridiculous. They’ve been teased about this since they became friends in primary; is it really necessary to add fuel to the flame? “That’ s why it’ s so good!” Merlin calls from the bathroom. Arthur sighs. The things he does for him. “Are you nearly finished or are we going to be three hours late again?” “Yeah yeah, done in a second! This bloody beard doesn’ t want to stick,” Merlin says. “Need any help?” Arthur asks as he tightens the belt around his waist and pulls on his red cape. He grabs the small pink, purpl e, and blue dragon pin from Merlin’ s desk and fiddles with it. It’s his favourite pride pin, given to him by Merlin after he finally gathered up the courage to tell him that he likes people romantically and no one sexua lly, regardless of gender . It still scares him to wear it, despite the pride he feels. He wonders how long it’ll take before it stops making his stomach swoop anxiously , if it ever will stop. “No, all good!” Merlin says, and then he’s bouncing out from the bathroom and Arthur can’t help the loud laugh that escapes him. “You look absolutely ridiculous,” he says. “Remind me to never let you grow a beard.” Merlin pouts at him, and it makes him look even more bizarre in his red robes and long white fake beard and scraggly wig. He’ s even added wrinkles. “Who said Merlin the Wizard had to be old?” Arthur asks, still fiddling with the pin in his hands. “Maybe he was a fit young sorcerer .” Merlin rolls his eyes and steps forward, hands reaching to grab the pin from Arthur ’s hands. He hums as he removes the pin lock. “King Arthur ’s young lover , perhaps?” he says, glancing up briefly at Arthur before he returns his attention to fastening the pin to Arthur ’s cape. Arthur swallows. “W ell, history always did have a way of being pretty gay .” Merlin snorts. “You can say that again.” He finishes fastening the pin, runs his hands over the fabric of the cape, and then steps back. He grins at Arthur . “Now we match,” he says, tugging at his red robes and the bi-coloured butterfly and the non-binary he/him pins fastened on the left side of his chest. Arthur huf fs out a laugh, heart thudding in his chest. “You look great,” Merlin adds, giving him a once-over . “The Great King of Camelot.” “Thanks,” Arthur says, voice hoarse. He clears his throat. “Y ou look old.” Merlin rolls his eyes at him again, and really it fits his costume perfectly . “Prat.” “That’ s Your Royal Prat to you, Sorce rer,” Arthur says as he makes sure he has all his things and picks up Merli n’s phone before grabbing hold of Merlin’ s arm. “Now come on, the court awaits us.” Gwaine has really gone all out. His house is decked out with skeletons and ghosts and spider - web, a row of pumpkins that Arthur recognises from their annual pumpkin-carving competition litters his front porch, and the music blasting from the living room is nothing if not the Ghostbusters soundtrack. Gwaine himself is dressed in a leather costume that shows more skin than perhaps is socially acceptable but is entirely expected from him and a winged eyeliner that even Arthur is jealous of even if he very rarely wears makeup. No way the Playboy bunnies are getting all the fun, as Gwai ne said a few years ago when he wore a literal Playboy bunny outfit for Halloween. He’ s only outdone himself since. “Friends! You made it,” he calls when they walk through the door. “I’m loving the couple’ s costume,” he says with a wide grin. Arthur rolls his eyes at him and lets himself be pulled into a mostly naked hug. “Thanks. It was all Merlin’ s idea,” he says when Gwaine pulls Merlin into a similar hug. Gwaine grins at Merlin, slapping him on the shoulder . “Of course it was.” Merlin grins back at him proudly . His fake beard is already starting to peel, so Arthur pushes it back in place. “You want anything to drink?” Gwaine asks, motioning towards the kitchen that is only a little less crowded than the living room and the hall. Arthur shrugs. “Why not.” “I’m alright, thanks. I’m going to find Gwen! I promised her I’d show her my outfit as soon as I came,” Merlin says, waving them off and disappearing into the throng of people and further into the house. “Alright then, what can I offer you, Princess?” Gwaine asks as he leads Arthur into the kitchen. There are orange streamers hanging from the ceiling and the kitchen table is littered with an array of drinks and bottles. Arthur rolls his eyes again. “Honestly , anything’ s fine so long as it’s not deadly . I do have to attend lunch with my father and sister tomorrow , and as much as I think Morgana would love to see me hungover I don’t think Father would be too impressed,” he says, scowling when Gwaine grins at him. “Your daddy’s always been a stick in the mud,” he says, and Arthur scrunc hes his nose up at the choice of word , but can’t disagr ee with the rest. “I’m going to make you a potion of courage so you can finally get around to telling Merlin how you feel. You’ll only feel it a little in the morning , I promise,” he says with a smile that tells Arthur he’s definitely going to feel it more than a little. Arthur purses his lips and gives him an unimpressed glare, but doesn’ t stop him when Gwaine grabs a few of the bottles strewn across the table and starts pouring liquids of different colours into a glass. “Oh, come on, mate. You’ve been pining for him since primary school. Don’ t you think it’s about time?” Honestly Arthur doesn’ t know why he ever told Gwaine about his feelings for Merlin, but then he probably wasn’ t very sober when he did and it was definitely Gwaine and his scarily- tasty, very-alcoholic drinks’ fault. He raises an eyebrow when Gwaine drops a small, round item into his drink and holds it out to him. “And I’m perfectly fine pining until I die,” he says, taking the glass and watching the fake eye bob up and down in the colourful drink. He gives Gwaine a skeptical look before taking a sip. “Oh my god,” he says, making a face. It’ s way too strong and tastes way too good. “What the hell did you put in this?” Gwaine just grins at him and slaps him on the shoulder . “Just think about it,” he says, before slipping out of the kitchen. Arthur doesn’ t tell him that he has thought about it, multiple times. He takes another sip from the drink and grimaces again. God he’s not having any more to drink after this one. Arthur has thought about it, more times than he can count, really , has been close to telling Merlin a handful of times too. And yet, Gwaine’ s words make him think about it again, because honestly he isn’t sure he really is fine pining until the day he dies. He loves being friends with Merlin more than anything and if that’ s what they’re always going to be then that is more than fine with him, but he’s not sure he could go his entire life not knowing if that’s what Merlin wants or if their relationship could be something else. It’s probably the ridiculous amount of alcohol in the drink Gwaine made, but he’s feeling a little daring tonight. He won’ t ever know what Merlin feels if he never asks, right? So he spends almost half an hour walking through Gwaine’ s house trying to find Merlin somewhere in the crowd of witches and superheroes and pirates and ghosts, with little success. But he’ s made up his mind now , and like hell he’ s going to chicken out. It’s only when he goes outside into the cold night air that he spots him in the corner of the garden, face softly illuminated by the string of yellow lights hanging in the red and orange trees. He’s sitting, rather close, too, and laughing with a girl — Freya, Arthur thinks, from one of Merlin’ s nerdy societies. They’re turned towards each other , knees touching and smiles on their faces, caught in conve rsation. They look like they’ve forgotten the rest of the world exists, as if there’ s only the two of them, and Arthur ’s stomach drops. He guesses he wasn’ t meant to tell Merlin today either . He’s just about to turn around and go back inside when Merlin spots him. Merlin turns and grins at him, and Arthur , in turn, just gives him an awkward wave. Merlin turns back to Freya, saying something that has her smiling widely and nodding, and then he ducks in to leave a lingering kiss on her cheek before standing up and making his way towards Arthur . He doesn’ t take his eyes off her until he’s reached him, and Arthur supposes there’ s no need to ask. It’ s plenty obvious what Merlin feels. So, instead, he forces a grin and wiggles his eyebrows when Merlin finally looks at him. Merlin just laughs, cheeks dusted red, and punches him in the arm. V. The tube is crowded, with people packed shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and groups of friends squeezed too many into a row of seats. Arthur is tucked — more like wedged, really — between Merlin and Percival, the rest of their friends crammed in around them. There’ s really no use in trying to follow any of the conversations happening around him with the loud noise of the train and the laughter and chatter filling the car from all directions, and it’s much too tight to get a hold of his phone, so Arthur settles with staring off into the space in front of him. Which happens to hold a glum looking Merlin. It’s not very cold on the tube — the body temperature of all eight hundre d or so people are doing wonders against the early November cold — but Merlin is wrapped up in his usual blue scarf, chin tucked into it, and huddled into a thick rust red jacket. The dark grey wool beanie he’s wear ing has a small cat with a red neckerchief on the brim, his dark hair curling around it. He’s clearly trying to follow whatev er conversation Morgana, Leon, Lance, and Gwen are having on the other side of Percival, but Arthur can barely hear them so he figures Merlin isn’t much better off. He knows why he’s trying though, knows why there’s a small frown pulling at his brow and why there’ s a tired set to his shoulders and bags under his eyes. Arthur wishes he could help, wishes he could cheer him up, get him out of his own head and forget about Freya for a moment, but he’s shit at these things. What do you tell someone who’ s just been broken up with by their year-long girlfriend? Merlin really liked Freya, probably even loved her; what do you say to someone who’ s gotten their heart broken? Arthur isn’t sure he’d want anyone to say anything reassuring to him at all, honestly . It’s all empty words, anyway . So he doesn’ t say anything reassuring. Instead, he says, “Your face is going to get stuck if you keep frowning like that,” because he’ s an idiot. Merlin rolls his eyes at him, but the frown loosens up just the slightest, so Arthur takes it as a win. “You’re one to speak, with how you brood half the time. You’re going to get wrinkles,” Merlin retorts. Arthur gapes at him, af fronted. “I don’ t brood!” Merlin snorts. He squeezes his hand up between them and runs his thumb over Arthur ’s forehead. “Then what’ s this, Mr. Sunshine?” he says, and Arthur immediately tries to relax the scowl he’d barely noticed. “I’m a delight, thank you very much.” Merlin huffs out a laugh, and it’s a little happier , at least. Instead of trying to pull his arm down to his side again, he simply lets it rest against Arthur ’s chest, hand steady on his shoulder . Arthur wonders if Merlin can feel his heart beating loudly in his chest. “You’re about as delightful as the flu,” Merlin tells him. Arthur can’t help himself, and smirks, wiggling his eyebrows. “What, getting you all hot and bothered?” he asks, and Merlin lets out a loud, startled laugh. Warmth fills Arthur ’s chest at the look Merlin gives him, his eyes twinkling with mirth. He hasn’ t seen Merlin smile so widely in weeks. He grins crookedly back at him. “You wish,” Merlin says, and becaus e their proximity means he can’t punch Arthur in the arm like he usually would, he resorts to pinching his neck lightly . Arthur complains out loud, and wonders silently if he should admit that yes, he kind of does. “This station is W ood Gr een,” the announcement sounds over the intercom, and as soon as the tube stops almost the entire car fills out into the station. And from there it’s a rush of bodies and excitement and street food and drinks, watching the large bonfire get lit and its fire grow , yelling more than speaking the rhyme, and cheering over the morbid tradition of watching a man made of straw be set on fire. It’s fun and pleasant and the drinks are warm where the night is cold, and they’re all bundled together as close to the fire as they can get. Arthur stands next to Merlin, a cup of hot apple cider in his hands, watchin g from the corner of his eye as Merlin stares absentmindedly into the fire. The light of the bonfire casts shadows and a yellow glow across his face that makes him look ethereal. The quiet content in his eyes has Arthu r’s heart aching in his chest, because Merlin deserves this always, to feel content and happy and cherished. Merlin deserves to know that someone loves him, now more than ever , when he feels broken and unloveable. It’s their final year, and while Arthur doesn’ t think he could let go of Merl in again so easily , they’re graduating soon and life takes turns you don’t expect it to. He might not get another chance, might not gather up the courage again before it’ s too late. “Merlin,” he starts, and Merlin turns to him with a hum, eyes softly crinkled at the corners. His cheeks are a little rosy from the nipping wind, but he looks warm and comfortable and Arthur is so ridiculously in love. Arthur opens his mouth to continue — to tell him, finally — but that’s when the first firework goes off and the world is lit with a wonderful array of colours. Merlin turns his head with a surprised laugh to watch the display in the night sky, but Arthur pays more attention to the way the colours illuminate Merlin’ s face and how they reflect in his wide, awestruck eyes. Merlin’ s face is lit up in delight by the time the colours fade. He turns to Arthur with a blinding smile, and Arthur swallows. Because he can’t risk taking this away from him, not now, not for such selfish reasons as his own. “What were you going to say?” Merlin asks, and Arthur shakes his head. There’ll be another time, a time when Merlin isn’t heart broken and his eyes don’t reflect the night sky, when Arthur can form the words instead of just wanting to stare at him in awe. “Nothing,” he says. “Just… glad you’re here.” Merlin beams at him and bumps their shoulders. He doesn’ t pull away afterwards. “Me too.” + I. It’s a cold, wet Saturday in late Novem ber. The air is cold and the trees are bare, and the day has been lovely , the air crisp and the sky blue — up until about an hour ago. Then lunchtime came around and so did the dark clouds hanging heavy over Arthur ’s head, and of course it would start pouring down the mome nt he stepped out from the safety of the under ground station. As he rushes through the streets in the rain he’s eternally grateful that he had the foresight to bring a raincoat and that Merlin decided on meeting for a coffee rather than the walk he first suggested. A bell jingles as he pushes the door to The Round Table open and steps inside, coat dripping water onto the floor despite the short trip from the station to the café. He pulls the hood down and unzips the coat as he glances around the small and cozy space. It’s of little surprise that Merlin is nowhere to be seen; he does have a penchant for being late. Arthur decides to order while he waits, and scans over the menus above the bar. They’re all changed from their autumn and Halloween specials to limited winter and Christmas drinks, and the shelves are lined with yule logs, Christmas puddings, and fruity mince pies amongst their usual pastries and cakes. The only thing that’s missing, really , is the Christmas decoration and All I Want For Christmas Is You playing from the speakers, but Arthur figures it’s probably only a matter of days. He doesn ’t dislike Christmas per se, but he doesn’ t usually try to get himself into the Christmas spirit until December 1st, so he’s happy to see they still offer their autumn assortment. He orders a vegan caramel and hazelnut latte and a black coffee with a splash of dairy-free milk and a pinch of cinnam on. Just as he’s about to pay he throws in one of the gingerbread muffins too because he can’t help himself. It’s only a week until December , anyway . He’s just sat down with the drinks and the pastry when the bell above the door jingles again, a mop of wet, dark hair and dark blue eyes looking around until they spot him. Merlin grins widely and makes his way through the café. The corner of Arthur ’s mouth tugs up just the slightest. “Sorry I’m late!” Merlin says when he reaches him, and he does at least have the decency to look like he means it. “I forgot my umbrella at home and was hoping I could wait out the rain at the station,” he says as he shrugs off his wet coat and hangs it over the chair in front of Arthur . His hair is dripping water onto his dark green sweater and his cheeks are flushed a bright red from the cold. Arthur rolls his eyes good heartedly . “Only you, Merlin.” “That’ s not true!” Merlin exclaims, ruffling his hair and successfully splattering water droplets everywhere. “The forecast didn’ t say anything about a downpour!” “It did say it was going to rain,” Arthur points out. Merlin rolls his eyes as he steps aroun d the table. “It didn’ t say it was going to rain this much . Clotpole,” he says, and then he bends down and pulls Arthur into a tight, warm — if a little wet — hug. “I missed you.” Arthur wraps his arms around Merlin’ s back and hugs him back just as tightly . It’s only been a few months, and it’s not like they haven’ t talked, but between internships and work and Merlin being away as part of his graduate position, they’ve barely had any time to meet since graduation. And Arthur has missed him something fiercely . “We talked yesterday ,” he says, just to be an arse, and Merlin huffs out a laugh and hugs him just a little tighter . Arthur grins. “I missed you too.” Merlin squeezes him one more time and then he pulls back, plopping into his chair and pulling his waiting cup of coffee towards him. He takes a sip and hums satisfied, his lips pulling into a grin. The corners of it are soft and warm. “So, what ’s happened in your life? I want to know everything,” he says, leaning his elbows against the table. Arthur huffs out a laugh and takes a sip from his own warm drink. “You already know everything,” he says. “Nothing new has happened in the last eighteen hours, surprisingly enough.” Merlin just continues to grin at him. “How was the Halloween party?” “Good,” Arthur says. “Gwaine and Percy fell into the pool and Leon had to pull them out. They were both grounded and forced to spend the rest of the night sobering up in Gwaine’ s bathroom,” he tells him with a chuck le. “And Gwen looked so gorgeous in her costume we all thought Lance was going to get down and propose any second.” He grins. “Although I think he’ s probably got something a little more special planned.” Merlin chuckles. “Maybe not the most romantic situation when people are dressed up in outfits ranging from nothing to absolute absurdity and everyone is well beyond drunk. Good choice, Lance.” “I’m pretty sure Gwen would say yes if he proposed in a dumpster , to be fair .” Merlin laughs, warm and happy . “Yeah, she would.” “My costume wasn’ t nearly as good without my sorcerer , though,” Arthur says, and Merlin smiles widely . “I’m sure the mighty King Arthur is just as striking without him,” he says. Arthur shrugs. “Maybe,” he says, hiding his smile behind his cup. “But he definitely felt like something was missing.” Merlin’ s bright eyes crinkle at the corners. “I guess his sorcerer will have to make sure to show up next time, then,” he says. “I’m holding you to that,” Arthur says, giving him a pointed look. “So, how was Manchester? Seemed like you had a lot of fun.” Merlin’ s entire face lights up. “I did! It was so interesting to finally see everything I’ve learnt actually be used in practice, you know?” he says, and then he goes on a ramble about everything he saw in the three months he was away , everyone he met, all the things he got to do. Arthur has already heard more than half of this, but he has only heard it over the phone and through video calls with poor connection, and he’ll never mind hearing Merlin speak, no matter how many times he has to hear the same thing. A little distance and four months apart and the feelings in Arthur ’s chest haven’ t diminished in the slightest. At this point he figures they probably never will. “-and Sefa has promised to come here just before Christmas; we were thinking of heading up to Edinbur gh for the Christmas market. I’m just really excited to see her again, even if we saw each other a few weeks ago,” Merlin says with a laugh. He speaks about her a lot, Sefa, and it’ s clear he likes her . Arthur just isn’ t sure in which way . So he raises his eyebrow suggestively , and Merlin’ s quick to wave him of f. “No, it’s nothing like that,” he says with a chuckle. “We’re friends, and I’m pretty sure she and Daegal have something going on,” he adds and grins. Arthur nods in understanding, but frowns when Merlin gives him a funny look. “How about you?” Merlin asks, averting his eyes and grabbing one of the forks on the table. He pokes at the gingerbread muffin. “Mithian seems nice,” he says, and there’ s a strange tilt to his voice. And sure, Mithian is nice. Quite lovely , actually , and Arthur could see something happening between them, if he wasn’ t so damn gone on the person sitting in front of him. And so, this time, Arthur doesn’ t hesitate, doesn’ t stop himself or let himself back down. This time, he lets the words he’s wanted to say for so long roll off his tongue with an ease that really isn’ t all that surprising. “She is,” Merlin’ s lips tug up into something that is probably supposed to be a smile but looks more like a grimace, “but I’m far too busy pining over my best friend for the nth year in a row to really consider it.” It feels not so scary and very relievin g, to finally share the secret he never wanted to keep to begin with. Merlin snaps his head up to stare at him with wide eyes and Arthur rolls his eyes at him. “Oh come on, you can’ t be that oblivious.” Merlin huffs out a laugh and shakes his head. “No. I just wasn’ t expecting you to actually admit it,” he says, and Arthur frowns at him. “I’ve been waiting for you to say something since we were fifteen.” Arthur balks. “Why did you wait for me to say something? If you knew , why didn’ t you say so?” Merlin shrugs, shoving a piece of muffin into his mouth. “I didn’ t want to force you to share something you weren’ t ready for, or feel like you were obligated to do anything about it. I know your dad isn’ t…” he grimaces, “the most approving.” Arthur snorts. “No shit. But seriously , since year ten?” he asks, and Merlin nods. Arthur huffs out a laugh, and leans back in his chair . “Guess all my anxiety about telling you was pretty unnecessary .” Merlin gives him a soft smile. “Y ou never needed to be anxious.” “I know ,” Arthur says with a sigh. “I’ve wanted you to know since I figured it out, but it always came up at bad times or something came in the way and ruined the moment,” he says. Merlin laughs. “But at a café on a random, miserable Saturday afternoon fit the bill?” he asks, mirth in his eyes. Arthur pushes down his own grin and shrugs. “Figured it was as good a day as any .” “Say it again,” Merlin says, leaning forward in his chair , his lips stretching wide as he smiles. Arthur rolls his eyes at him, but he feels his smile tug at his own cheeks. “I love you.” “I know that,” Merlin says with laughter in his voice. “Say the other thing,” he tells him. Arthur huf fs out a breath of a laugh and moves forwards so he’ s also leaning over the table. “I’m in love with you,” he says, holding Merlin’ s gaze. He doesn’ t bother fighting the smile anymore. “Have been since I was eleven.” Merlin grins, wide and bright and warm, and then he ducks forward and his lips catch Arthur ’s in a kiss that tastes like cinnamon and coffee and caramel. It is new and exciting just the same as it feels entirely natural, like something Arthur has done a hundred times before, something he’ll do hundreds and hundreds of times again. “Good,” Merlin says when he pulls away . “Because I’m in love with you too and I’d really like to add ‘boyfriend’ to the list of things I refer to you as in my head.” Arthur runs a thumb over Merlin’ s cheekbone and raises an eyebrow . He probably shouldn’ t ask, but he can’ t help himself. “Oh? And what other names do you have on that list?” “Clotpoll. Prat. Best friend. Ass. Arthur . Cabbagehead. Love of my life. Dollophead.” He laughs and kisses Merlin again. “Wouldn’ t be a complete list without boyfriend on there, would it?” Merlin grins at him again, bright and warm enough to rival the sun. “No, no it wouldn’ t.” End Notes Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it!

                <div class="summary">Arthur had finally put his finger on it.The thing that had made Merlin stand out, the thing that had intrigued him about the boy ever since the first time he’d met him. The thing that was going to get him killed… Merlin had magic. Not only had it, but used it freely all the bloody time. It was only a matter of time before someone saw him do it, and then they’d report him to the king and Merlin would be dragged out into the courtyard and executed.Well, not if Arthur had anything to do about it.Mid series one, Arthur, for once not being totally oblivious, discovers that Merlin has magic. The problem is, having magic gets people killed and Arthur very much prefers Merlin alive. It turns out making sure nobody sees Merlin do magic is rather a full-time job however...</div>

                <div class="summary">&quot;I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d have done.&quot;&quot;And I didn&#x27;t want to put you in that position.”For better or for worse, Arthur knows Merlin&#x27;s secret. The problem? Merlin doesn&#x27;t know Arthur knows. This leaves Arthur with a predicament... and an opportunity. A test. Three trials and three opportunities for Merlin to prove he doesn&#x27;t deserve death. Arthur hopes he will pass them. Maybe then the image of Merlin&#x27;s golden eyes will stop haunting him.Merlin opened his mouth. A noise unlike any sound Arthur had ever heard escaped from it. Loud and rumbling and guttural, inhuman, and in no way, shape, or form could actually be coming from his manservant.But it was. And Merlin was speaking.&quot;O drakon, e male so ftengometta tesd&#x27;hup&#x27;anankes! Erkheo!&quot;For a minute, there was complete silence—a silence in which Arthur just stared from behind a tree in an incomprehensive daze.But then there was a sound. Both loud and forceful and... familiar.The sound of flapping wings.AKA an in-depth character study of Arthur. I do not endorse Arthur&#x27;s actions, but this is what I think he&#x27;d do in canon. This was my season 3 prediction!</div>
